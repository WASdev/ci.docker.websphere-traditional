## Raising Issues

Please raise any bug reports or feature requests on the [WebSphere Traditional Container Images project repository's GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/WASdev/ci.docker.websphere-traditional/issues). Search the list to see if your issue has already been raised.

A good bug report is one that makes it easy for everyone to understand what you were trying to do and what went wrong. Please provide as much context as possible so we can try to recreate the issue.

## Legal

We use the same approach - the Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1 (DCO) - that the LinuxÂ® Kernel community uses to manage code contributions.

For us to accept pull requests, you must declare that you wrote the code or, at least, have the right to contribute it to the repo under the open source license of the project in the repo. It's that easy.

1. Read the following terms from [DCO](https://elinux.org/Developer_Certificate_Of_Origin) :

  ```
Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
    this project or the open source license(s) involved.
  ```

2. If you can certify that it is true, sign off your `git commit` with a message like this:
  ```
  Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@example.com>
  ```
  You must use your real name (no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions, sorry).
  
  Instead of typing that in every git commit message, your Git tools might let you automatically add the details for you. If you configure them to do that, when you issue the `git commit` command, just add the `-s` option.

If you are an IBMer, please contact us directly, as the contribution process is slightly different.

## Coding Standards

Please ensure you follow the coding standards used throughout the existing code base.
