The Academic Free License<br>
v.2.1<br>
<br>
This Academic Free License (the &#34;License&#34;) applies to any original work of authorship (the &#34;Original Work&#34;) whose owner (the &#34;Licensor&#34;) has placed the following notice immediately following the copyright notice for the Original Work:<br>
<br>
Licensed under the Academic Free License version 2.1<br>
<br>
    1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license to do the following:<br>
        a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies;<br>
        b) to prepare derivative works (&#34;Derivative Works&#34;) based upon the Original Work;<br>
        c) to distribute copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to the public;<br>
        d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and<br>
        e) to display the Original Work publicly.<br>
    2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license, under patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, to make, use, sell and offer for sale the Original Work and Derivative Works.<br>
    3) Grant of Source Code License. The term &#34;Source Code&#34; means the preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor hereby agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing the address of that information repository in a notice immediately following the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.<br>
    4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this Original Work without express prior written permission of the Licensor. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or offer to sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.<br>
    5) This section intentionally omitted.<br>
    6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an &#34;Attribution Notice.&#34; You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work.<br>
    7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately proceeding sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an &#34;AS IS&#34; BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No license to Original Work is granted hereunder except under this disclaimer.<br>
    8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to any person for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from Licensor&#39;s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.<br>
    9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. Nothing else but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) grants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work or to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt to do so except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the equivalent laws of other countries, and by international treaty. Therefore, by exercising any of the rights granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate Your acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions.<br>
    10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or hardware.<br>
    11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 101 et seq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and international treaty. This section shall survive the termination of this License.<br>
    12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys&#39; fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this License.<br>
    13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.<br>
    14) Definition of &#34;You&#34; in This License. &#34;You&#34; throughout this License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal entities, &#34;You&#34; includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, &#34;control&#34; means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.<br>
    15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.<br>

   transformation or translation of a Source form, including but<br>
   not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,<br>
   and conversions to other media types.<br>
<br>
   &#34;Work&#34; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or<br>
   Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a<br>
   copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work<br>
   (an example is provided in the Appendix below).<br>
<br>
   &#34;Derivative Works&#34; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object<br>
   form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the<br>
   editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications<br>
   represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes<br>
   of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain<br>

   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br>
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br>
   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,<br>
   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the<br>
   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.<br>
<br>
3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br>
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br>
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br>
   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,<br>
   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,<br>
   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable<br>
   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their<br>
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)<br>
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You<br>
   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br>
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work<br>
   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct<br>
   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br>
   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br>
   as of the date such litigation is filed.<br>
<br>
4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<br>
   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without<br>
   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You<br>
   meet the following conditions:<br>
<br>
   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br>
       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br>
<br>
   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<br>
       stating that You changed the files; and<br>
<br>
   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br>
       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br>
       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br>
       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br>
       the Derivative Works; and<br>
<br>
   (d) If the Work includes a &#34;NOTICE&#34; text file as part of its<br>
       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br>
       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br>
       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br>
       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br>
       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br>
       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br>
       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br>
       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br>
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br>
       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br>
       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br>
       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br>
       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br>
       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br>
       as modifying the License.<br>
<br>
   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br>
   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br>
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br>
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br>
   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br>
   the conditions stated in this License.<br>
<br>
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br>
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br>
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br>
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br>
   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br>
   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br>
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br>
<br>
6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br>
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br>
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br>
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br>
<br>
7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br>
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br>
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &#34;AS IS&#34; BASIS,<br>
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br>
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br>
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br>
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br>
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br>

   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br>
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br>
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br>
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br>
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br>
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br>
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br>

NOTICE; LIMITED LICENSE GRANTS<br>
<br>
1. License for Purposes of Evaluation and Developing Applications. Licensor<br>
hereby grants you a fully-paid, non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide,<br>
limited license (without the right to sublicense), under Licensor&#39;s applicable<br>
intellectual property rights to view, download, use and reproduce the<br>
Specification only for the purpose of internal evaluation. This includes<br>
developing applications intended to run on an implementation of the<br>
Specification provided that such applications do not themselves implement any<br>
portion(s) of the Specification.<br>
<br>
2. License for the Distribution of Compliant Implementations. Licensor also<br>
grants you a perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, fully<br>
paid-up, royalty free, limited license (without the right to sublicense) under<br>
any applicable copyrights or, subject to the provisions of subsection 4 below,<br>
patent rights it may have covering the Specification to create and/or distribute<br>
an Independent Implementation of the Specification that: (a) fully implements<br>
the Specification including all its required interfaces and functionality; (b)<br>
does not modify, subset, superset or otherwise extend the Licensor Name Space,<br>
or include any public or protected packages, classes, Java interfaces, fields or<br>
methods within the Licensor Name Space other than those required/authorized by<br>
the Specification or Specifications being implemented; and (c) passes the<br>
Technology Compatibility Kit (including satisfying the requirements of the<br>
applicable TCK Users Guide) for such Specification (&#34;Compliant Implementation&#34;).<br>
In addition, the foregoing license is expressly conditioned on your not acting<br>
outside its scope. No license is granted hereunder for any other purpose<br>
(including, for example, modifying the Specification, other than to the extent<br>
of your fair use rights, or distributing the Specification to third parties).<br>
<br>
3. Pass-through Conditions. You need not include limitations (a)-(c) from the<br>
previous paragraph or any other particular &#34;pass through&#34; requirements in any<br>
license You grant concerning the use of your Independent Implementation or<br>
products derived from it. However, except with respect to Independent<br>
Implementations (and products derived from them) that satisfy limitations<br>
(a)-(c) from the previous paragraph, You may neither: (a) grant or otherwise<br>
pass through to your licensees any licenses under Licensor&#39;s applicable<br>
intellectual property rights; nor (b) authorize your licensees to make any<br>
claims concerning their implementation&#39;s compliance with the Specification.<br>
<br>
4. Reciprocity Concerning Patent Licenses. With respect to any patent claims<br>
covered by the license granted under subparagraph 2 above that would be<br>
infringed by all technically feasible implementations of the Specification, such<br>
license is conditioned upon your offering on fair, reasonable and<br>
non-discriminatory terms, to any party seeking it from You, a perpetual,<br>
non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide license under Your patent rights that<br>
are or would be infringed by all technically feasible implementations of the<br>
Specification to develop, distribute and use a Compliant Implementation.<br>
<br>
5. Definitions. For the purposes of this Agreement: &#34;Independent Implementation&#34;<br>
shall mean an implementation of the Specification that neither derives from any<br>
of Licensor&#39;s source code or binary code materials nor, except with an<br>
appropriate and separate license from Licensor, includes any of Licensor&#39;s<br>
source code or binary code materials; &#34;Licensor Name Space&#34; shall mean the<br>
public class or interface declarations whose names begin with &#34;java&#34;, &#34;javax&#34;,<br>
&#34;javax.jcr&#34; or their equivalents in any subsequent naming convention adopted by<br>
Licensor through the Java Community Process, or any recognized successors or<br>
replacements thereof; and &#34;Technology Compatibility Kit&#34; or &#34;TCK&#34; shall mean the<br>
test suite and accompanying TCK User&#39;s Guide provided by Licensor which<br>
corresponds to the particular version of the Specification being tested.<br>
<br>
6. Termination. This Agreement will terminate immediately without notice from<br>
Licensor if you fail to comply with any material provision of or act outside the<br>
scope of the licenses granted above.<br>
<br>
7. Trademarks. No right, title, or interest in or to any trademarks, service<br>
marks, or trade names of Licensor is granted hereunder. Java is a registered<br>
trademark of Sun Microsystems, Inc. in the United States and other countries.<br>
<br>
8. Disclaimer of Warranties. The Specification is provided &#34;AS IS&#34;. LICENSOR<br>
MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT<br>
NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,<br>
NON-INFRINGEMENT (INCLUDING AS A CONSEQUENCE OF ANY PRACTICE OR IMPLEMENTATION<br>
OF THE SPECIFICATION), OR THAT THE CONTENTS OF THE SPECIFICATION ARE SUITABLE<br>
FOR ANY PURPOSE. This document does not represent any commitment to release or<br>
implement any portion of the Specification in any product.<br>
<br>
The Specification could include technical inaccuracies or typographical errors.<br>
Changes are periodically added to the information therein; these changes will be<br>
incorporated into new versions of the Specification, if any. Licensor may make<br>
improvements and/or changes to the product(s) and/or the program(s) described in<br>
the Specification at any time. Any use of such changes in the Specification will<br>
be governed by the then-current license for the applicable version of the<br>
Specification.<br>
<br>
9. Limitation of Liability. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT<br>
WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST<br>
REVENUE, PROFITS OR DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br>
PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY,<br>
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO ANY FURNISHING, PRACTICING, MODIFYING OR ANY USE OF<br>
THE SPECIFICATION, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br>
DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
10. Report. If you provide Licensor with any comments or suggestions in<br>
connection with your use of the Specification (&#34;Feedback&#34;), you hereby: (i)<br>
agree that such Feedback is provided on a non-proprietary and non-confidential<br>
basis, and (ii) grant Licensor a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, fully<br>
paid-up, irrevocable license, with the right to sublicense through multiple<br>
levels of sublicensees, to incorporate, disclose, and use without limitation the<br>
Feedback for any purpose related to the Specification and future versions,<br>
implementations, and test suites thereof.<br>

&#34;Derivative Works&#34; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object <br>
form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the <br>
editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications <br>
represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes <br>
of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain <br>
separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, <br>
the Work and Derivative Works thereof. <br>
<br>
&#34;Contribution&#34; shall mean any work of authorship, including the original <br>
version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or <br>
Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor <br>
for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or <br>
Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For <br>
the purposes of this definition, &#34;submitted&#34; means any form of <br>
electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its <br>
representatives, including but not limited to communication on <br>
electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue <br>
tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for <br>
the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding <br>
communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in <br>
writing by the copyright owner as &#34;Not a Contribution.&#34; <br>
<br>
&#34;Contributor&#34; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on <br>
behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and <br>
subsequently incorporated within the Work. <br>
<br>
2. Grant of Copyright License. <br>
<br>
Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor <br>
hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, <br>
royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare <br>
Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and <br>
distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form. <br>
<br>
3. Grant of Patent License. <br>
<br>
Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor <br>
hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, <br>
royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent <br>
license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and <br>
otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those <br>
patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily <br>
infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their <br>
Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was <br>
submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity <br>
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the <br>
Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct <br>
or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to <br>
You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such <br>
litigation is filed. Any patent license granted hereby with respect to <br>
contributions by an individual employed by an institution or <br>
organization is limited to patent claims where the individual that is <br>
the author of the Work is also the inventor of the patent claims <br>
licensed, and where the organization or institution has the right to <br>
grant such license under applicable grant and research funding <br>
agreements. No other express or implied licenses are granted. <br>
<br>
4. Redistribution. <br>
<br>
You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works <br>
thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or <br>
Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions: <br>
<br>
1. You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a <br>
   copy of this License; and <br>
<br>
2. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating <br>
   that You changed the files; and <br>
<br>
3. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You <br>
   distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices <br>
   from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not <br>
   pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and <br>
<br>
4. If the Work includes a &#34;NOTICE&#34; text file as part of its <br>
   distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include <br>
   a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE <br>
   file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the <br>
   Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a <br>
   NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the <br>
   Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative <br>
   Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and <br>
   wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the <br>
   NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the <br>
   License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative <br>
   Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE <br>
   text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices <br>
   cannot be construed as modifying the License. <br>
<br>
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may <br>
provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, <br>
reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such <br>
Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and <br>
distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated <br>
in this License. <br>
<br>
5. Submission of Contributions. <br>
<br>
Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally <br>
submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be <br>
under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional <br>
terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall <br>
supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may <br>
have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions. <br>
<br>
6. Trademarks. <br>
<br>
This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, <br>
trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as <br>
required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of <br>
the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file. <br>
<br>
7. Disclaimer of Warranty. <br>
<br>
Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor <br>
provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on <br>
an &#34;AS IS&#34; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either <br>
express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or <br>
conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A <br>
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the <br>
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks <br>
associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License. <br>
<br>
8. Limitation of Liability. <br>
<br>
In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including <br>
negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law <br>
(such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, <br>
shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any <br>
direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any <br>
character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or <br>
inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss <br>
of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and <br>
all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has <br>
been advised of the possibility of such damages. <br>
<br>
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. <br>
<br>
While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may <br>
choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, <br>
indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with <br>
this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only <br>
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any <br>
other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold <br>
each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims <br>
asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such <br>
warranty or additional liability. <br>

 #  A large portion of the dictionary entries originate from ICOT Free <br>
 #  Software. The following conditions for ICOT Free Software applies to <br>
 #  the current dictionary as well. <br>
 #<br>
 #  Each User may also freely distribute the Program, whether in its<br>
 #  original form or modified, to any third party or parties, PROVIDED<br>
 #  that the provisions of Section 3 (&#34;NO WARRANTY&#34;) will ALWAYS appear<br>

 #  distribution itself. <br>
 #<br>
 #  NO WARRANTY<br>
 #  <br>
 #  The program was produced on an experimental basis in the course of <br>
 #  the research and development conducted during the project and is <br>
 #  provided to users as so produced on an experimental basis.  <br>
 #  Accordingly, the program is provided without any warranty <br>
 #  whatsoever, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise.  <br>
 #  The term &#34;warranty&#34; used herein includes, but is not limited to, any <br>
 #  warranty of the quality, performance, merchantability and fitness <br>
 #  for a particular purpose of the program and the nonexistence of any <br>
 #  infringement or violation of any right of any third party.<br>
 #  <br>
 #  Each user of the program will agree and understand, and be deemed to<br>
 #  have agreed and understood, that there is no warranty whatsoever for<br>
 #  the program and, accordingly, the entire risk arising from or<br>
 #  otherwise connected with the program is assumed by the user.<br>
 #  <br>
 #  Therefore, neither ICOT, the copyright holder, or any other<br>
 #  organization that participated in or was otherwise related to the<br>
 #  development of the program and their respective officials, <br>
 #  directors, officers and other employees shall be held liable for any <br>
 #  and all damages, including, without limitation, general, special, <br>
 #  incidental and consequential damages, arising out of or otherwise in <br>
 #  connection with the use or inability to use the program or any <br>
 #  product, material or result produced or otherwise obtained by using <br>
 #  the program, regardless of whether they have been advised of, or <br>
 #  otherwise had knowledge of, the possibility of such damages at any <br>
 #  time during the project or thereafter.  Each user will be deemed to <br>
 #  have agreed to the foregoing by his or her commencement of use of <br>
 #  the program.  The term &#34;use&#34; as used herein includes, but is not <br>
 #  limited to, the use, modification, copying and distribution of the <br>
 #  program and the production of secondary products from the program.<br>
 #  <br>
 #  In the case where the program, whether in its original form or<br>
 #  modified, was distributed or delivered to or received by a user from<br>
 #  any person, organization or entity other than ICOT, unless it makes <br>
 #  or grants independently of ICOT any specific warranty to the user in<br>

4. Time Zone Database<br>
<br>
  ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone <br>
  Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database <br>
  is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone <br>
  Database section 7.<br>
<br>
  7.  Database Ownership<br>
<br>
    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF<br>
    document. Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work<br>
    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the <br>
    public domain. Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do not <br>
    apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make to <br>
    it. Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ <br>
    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA Considerations <br>
    defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of understanding with the <br>
    IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance with all competent <br>
    court orders. No ownership claims will be made by ICANN or the IETF <br>
    Trust on the database or the code.  Any person making a contribution<br>
    to the database or code waives all rights to future claims in that<br>
    contribution or in the TZ Database.<br>

                       Version 2.1, February 1999<br>
<br>
Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<br>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts<br>
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence<br>
 the version number 2.1.]<br>
<br>
Preamble<br>
<br>
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to <br>
share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are <br>
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to <br>
make sure the software is free for all its users. <br>
<br>
This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some <br>
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free <br>
Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use <br>
it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this <br>
license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to <br>
use in any particular case, based on the explanations below. <br>
<br>
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not <br>
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you <br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for <br>
this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if <br>
you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in <br>
new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these <br>
things. <br>
<br>
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid <br>
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these <br>
rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you <br>
if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it. <br>
<br>
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or <br>
for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. <br>
You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. <br>
If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete <br>
object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the <br>
library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you <br>
must show them these terms so they know their rights. <br>
<br>
We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the <br>
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal <br>
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. <br>
<br>
To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is <br>
no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by <br>
someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they <br>
have is not the original version, so that the original author&#39;s <br>
reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by <br>
others. <br>
<br>
Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any <br>
free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively <br>
restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license <br>
from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license <br>
obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full <br>
freedom of use specified in this license. <br>
<br>
Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary <br>
GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public <br>
License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different <br>
from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for <br>
certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into <br>
non-free programs. <br>
<br>
When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a <br>
shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a <br>
combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary <br>
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire <br>
combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public <br>
License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the <br>
library. <br>
<br>
We call this license the &#34;Lesser&#34; General Public License because it does <br>
Less to protect the user&#39;s freedom than the ordinary General Public <br>
License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an <br>
advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the <br>
reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. <br>
However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special <br>
circumstances. <br>
<br>
For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to <br>
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it <br>
becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be <br>
allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library <br>
does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there <br>
is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so <br>
we use the Lesser General Public License. <br>
<br>
In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free <br>
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free <br>
software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free <br>
programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, <br>
as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system. <br>
<br>
Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the <br>
users&#39; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked <br>
with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program <br>
using a modified version of the Library. <br>
<br>
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and <br>
modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a <br>
&#34;work based on the library&#34; and a &#34;work that uses the library&#34;. The <br>
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must <br>
be combined with the library in order to run. TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR <br>
COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION <br>
<br>
0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other <br>
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other <br>
authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this <br>
Lesser General Public License (also called &#34;this License&#34;). Each <br>
licensee is addressed as &#34;you&#34;. <br>
<br>
A &#34;library&#34; means a collection of software functions and/or data <br>
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs <br>
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables. <br>
<br>
The &#34;Library&#34;, below, refers to any such software library or work which <br>
has been distributed under these terms. A &#34;work based on the Library&#34; <br>
means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: <br>
that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either <br>
verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into <br>
another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without <br>
limitation in the term &#34;modification&#34;.) <br>
<br>
&#34;Source code&#34; for a work means the preferred form of the work for making <br>
modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the <br>
source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface <br>
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and <br>
installation of the library. <br>
<br>
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not <br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running <br>
a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a <br>
program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the <br>
Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing <br>
it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the <br>
program that uses the Library does. <br>
<br>
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&#39;s complete <br>
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you <br>
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate <br>
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices <br>
that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and <br>
distribute a copy of this License along with the Library. <br>
<br>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and <br>
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. <br>
<br>
<br>
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of <br>
it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute <br>
such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided <br>
that you also meet all of these conditions: <br>
<br>
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices <br>
       stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge <br>
       to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a <br>
       table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses <br>
       the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility <br>
       is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure <br>
       that, in the event an application does not supply such function <br>
       or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part <br>
       of its purpose remains meaningful.<br>
<br>
      (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has <br>
      a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the <br>
      application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any <br>
      application-supplied function or table used by this function must <br>
      be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square <br>
      root function must still compute square roots.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If <br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and <br>
can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in <br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those <br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you <br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on <br>
the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this <br>
License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire <br>
whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. <br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest <br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to <br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or <br>
collective works based on the Library. <br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library <br>
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a <br>
storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the <br>
scope of this License. <br>
<br>
3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public <br>
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do <br>
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that <br>
they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, <br>
instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the <br>
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify <br>
that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these <br>
notices. <br>
<br>
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that <br>
copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all <br>
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy. <br>
<br>
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the <br>
Library into a program that is not a library. <br>
<br>
4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative <br>
of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the <br>
terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the <br>
complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be <br>
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium <br>
customarily used for software interchange. <br>
<br>
If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a <br>
designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source <br>
code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the <br>
source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the <br>
source along with the object code. <br>
<br>
5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, <br>
but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked <br>
with it, is called a &#34;work that uses the Library&#34;. Such a work, in <br>
isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls <br>
outside the scope of this License. <br>
<br>
However, linking a &#34;work that uses the Library&#34; with the Library creates <br>
an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains <br>
portions of the Library), rather than a &#34;work that uses the library&#34;. <br>
The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states <br>
terms for distribution of such executables. <br>
<br>
When a &#34;work that uses the Library&#34; uses material from a header file <br>
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a <br>
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. <br>
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked <br>
without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold <br>
for this to be true is not precisely defined by law. <br>
<br>
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure <br>
layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten <br>
lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is <br>
unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. <br>
(Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library <br>
will still fall under Section 6.) <br>
<br>
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may <br>
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. <br>
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether <br>
or not they are linked directly with the Library itself. <br>
<br>
6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a <br>
&#34;work that uses the Library&#34; with the Library to produce a work <br>
containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms <br>
of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work <br>
for the customer&#39;s own use and reverse engineering for debugging such <br>
modifications. <br>
<br>
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the <br>
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by <br>
this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during <br>
execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright <br>
notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the <br>
user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things: <br>
<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding <br>
       machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever <br>
       changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under <br>
       Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked <br>
       with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &#34;work that <br>
       uses the Library&#34;, as object code and/or source code, so that the <br>
       user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified <br>
       executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood <br>
       that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in <br>
       the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the <br>
       application to use the modified definitions.)<br>
    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the <br>
       Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a <br>
       copy of the library already present on the user&#39;s computer <br>
       system, rather than copying library functions into the <br>
       executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version <br>
       of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified <br>
       version is interface-compatible with the version that the work <br>
       was made with.<br>
    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three <br>
       years, to give the same user the materials specified in <br>
       Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of <br>
       performing this distribution.<br>
    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy <br>
       from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the <br>
       above specified materials from the same place.<br>
    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these <br>
       materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br>
<br>
For an executable, the required form of the &#34;work that uses the Library&#34; <br>
must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the <br>
executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be <br>
distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in <br>
either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, <br>
kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, <br>
unless that component itself accompanies the executable. <br>
<br>
It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions <br>
of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the <br>
operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them <br>
and the Library together in an executable that you distribute. <br>
<br>
7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library <br>
side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities <br>
not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, <br>
provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library <br>
and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided <br>
that you do these two things: <br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based <br>
       on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. <br>
       This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.<br>
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that <br>
       part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where <br>
       to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<br>
8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the <br>
Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt <br>
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the <br>
Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this <br>
License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you <br>
under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as <br>
such parties remain in full compliance. <br>
<br>
9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not <br>
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or <br>
distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are <br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by <br>
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the <br>
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all <br>
its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the <br>
Library or works based on it. <br>
<br>
10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the <br>
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the <br>
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library <br>
subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further <br>
restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein. <br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with <br>
this License. <br>
<br>
11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent <br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), <br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or <br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not <br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute <br>
so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and <br>
any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not <br>
distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would <br>
not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who <br>
receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you <br>
could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from <br>
distribution of the Library. <br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under <br>
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to <br>
apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other <br>
circumstances. <br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any <br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any <br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the <br>
integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented <br>
by public license practices. Many people have made generous <br>
contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that <br>
system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to <br>
the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute <br>
software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that <br>
choice. <br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be <br>
a consequence of the rest of this License. <br>
<br>
12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in <br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the <br>
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may <br>
add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those <br>
countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries <br>
not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the <br>
limitation as if written in the body of this License. <br>
<br>
13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions <br>
of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new <br>
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may <br>
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. <br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library <br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &#34;any <br>
later version&#34;, you have the option of following the terms and <br>
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by <br>
the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license <br>
version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free <br>
Software Foundation. <br>
<br>
14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free <br>
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, <br>
write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is <br>
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software <br>
Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be <br>
guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives <br>
of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software <br>
generally. <br>
<br>
NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO <br>
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. <br>
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR <br>
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &#34;AS IS&#34; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, <br>
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED <br>
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE <br>
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH <br>
YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL <br>
NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. <br>
<br>
16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN <br>
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY <br>
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR <br>
DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL <br>
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY <br>
(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED <br>
INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF <br>
THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR <br>
OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. <br>

<br>
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;<br>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
<br>
  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates<br>
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public<br>
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.<br>
<br>
  0. Additional Definitions.<br>
<br>
  As used herein, &#34;this License&#34; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License, and the &#34;GNU GPL&#34; refers to version 3 of the GNU<br>
General Public License.<br>
<br>
  &#34;The Library&#34; refers to a covered work governed by this License,<br>
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.<br>
<br>
  An &#34;Application&#34; is any work that makes use of an interface provided<br>
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.<br>
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode<br>
of using an interface provided by the Library.<br>
<br>
  A &#34;Combined Work&#34; is a work produced by combining or linking an<br>
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library<br>
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the &#34;Linked<br>
Version&#34;.<br>
<br>
  The &#34;Minimal Corresponding Source&#34; for a Combined Work means the<br>
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code<br>
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are<br>
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.<br>
<br>
  The &#34;Corresponding Application Code&#34; for a Combined Work means the<br>
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data<br>
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the<br>
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.<br>
<br>
  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br>
<br>
  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License<br>
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br>
<br>
  2. Conveying Modified Versions.<br>
<br>
  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a<br>
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application<br>
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the<br>
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified<br>
version:<br>
<br>
   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to<br>
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the<br>
   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs<br>
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or<br>
<br>
   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of<br>
   this License applicable to that copy.<br>
<br>
  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.<br>
<br>
  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from<br>
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object<br>
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated<br>
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure<br>
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates<br>
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:<br>
<br>
   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the<br>
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<br>
   covered by this License.<br>
<br>
   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<br>
   document.<br>
<br>
  4. Combined Works.<br>
<br>
  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,<br>
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the<br>
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse<br>
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of<br>
the following:<br>
<br>
   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that<br>
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<br>
   covered by this License.<br>
<br>
   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<br>
   document.<br>
<br>
   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during<br>
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among<br>
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the<br>
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.<br>
<br>
   d) Do one of the following:<br>
<br>
       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this<br>
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form<br>
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to<br>
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of<br>
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the<br>
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying<br>
       Corresponding Source.<br>
<br>
       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br>
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time<br>
       a copy of the Library already present on the user&#39;s computer<br>
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version<br>
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked<br>
       Version.<br>
<br>
   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise<br>
   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the<br>
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is<br>
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the<br>
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the<br>
   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If<br>
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany<br>
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application<br>
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation<br>
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL<br>
   for conveying Corresponding Source.)<br>
<br>
  5. Combined Libraries.<br>
<br>
  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
Library side by side in a single library together with other library<br>
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this<br>
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your<br>
choice, if you do both of the following:<br>
<br>
   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based<br>
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,<br>
   conveyed under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it<br>
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the<br>
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<br>
  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.<br>
<br>
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br>
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new<br>
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may<br>
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the<br>
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version<br>
of the GNU Lesser General Public License &#34;or any later version&#34;<br>
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and<br>
conditions either of that published version or of any later version<br>
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you<br>
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide<br>
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall<br>
apply, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of any version is<br>
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the<br>
Library.<br>
<br>
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
<br>
Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt; <br>
<br>
<br>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this <br>
license document, but changing it is not allowed. <br>
<br>
Preamble<br>
<br>
The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software <br>
and other kinds of works. <br>
<br>
The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to <br>
take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the <br>
GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to <br>
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free <br>
software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the <br>
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to <br>
any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to <br>
your programs, too. <br>
<br>
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. <br>
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the <br>
freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if <br>
you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, <br>
that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free <br>
programs, and that you know you can do these things. <br>
<br>
To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these <br>
rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have <br>
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if <br>
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others. <br>
<br>
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis <br>
or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that <br>
you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the <br>
source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their <br>
rights. <br>
<br>
Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) <br>
assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving <br>
you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it. <br>
<br>
For the developers&#39; and authors&#39; protection, the GPL clearly explains <br>
that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users&#39; and <br>
authors&#39; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as <br>
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to <br>
authors of previous versions. <br>
<br>
Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run <br>
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer <br>
can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting <br>
users&#39; freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such <br>
abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is <br>
precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed <br>
this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If <br>
such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to <br>
extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as <br>
needed to protect the freedom of users. <br>
<br>
Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. <br>
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of <br>
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to <br>
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could <br>
make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that <br>
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free. <br>
<br>
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and <br>
modification follow. <br>
<br>
<br>
TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
0. Definitions.<br>
<br>
&#34;This License&#34; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License. <br>
<br>
&#34;Copyright&#34; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds <br>
of works, such as semiconductor masks. <br>
<br>
&#34;The Program&#34; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this <br>
License. Each licensee is addressed as &#34;you&#34;. &#34;Licensees&#34; and <br>
&#34;recipients&#34; may be individuals or organizations. <br>
<br>
To &#34;modify&#34; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the <br>
work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making <br>
of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a &#34;modified version&#34; <br>
of the earlier work or a work &#34;based on&#34; the earlier work. <br>
<br>
A &#34;covered work&#34; means either the unmodified Program or a work based <br>
on the Program. <br>
<br>
To &#34;propagate&#34; a work means to do anything with it that, without <br>
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for <br>
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a <br>
computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, <br>
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the <br>
public, and in some countries other activities as well. <br>
<br>
To &#34;convey&#34; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other <br>
parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through <br>
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying. <br>
<br>
An interactive user interface displays &#34;Appropriate Legal Notices&#34; <br>
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible <br>
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells <br>
the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent <br>
that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under <br>
this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface <br>
presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent <br>
item in the list meets this criterion. <br>
<br>
1. Source Code.<br>
<br>
The &#34;source code&#34; for a work means the preferred form of the work <br>
for making modifications to it. &#34;Object code&#34; means any non-source <br>
form of a work. <br>
<br>
A &#34;Standard Interface&#34; means an interface that either is an official <br>
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of <br>
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is <br>
widely used among developers working in that language. <br>
<br>
The &#34;System Libraries&#34; of an executable work include anything, other <br>
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of <br>
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major <br>
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major <br>
Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an <br>
implementation is available to the public in source code form. A <br>
&#34;Major Component&#34;, in this context, means a major essential <br>
component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating <br>
system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to <br>
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it. <br>
<br>
The &#34;Corresponding Source&#34; for a work in object code form means all <br>
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable <br>
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to <br>
control those activities. However, it does not include the work&#39;s System <br>
Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs <br>
which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are <br>
not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes <br>
interface definition files associated with source files for the work, <br>
and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked <br>
subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as <br>
by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms <br>
and other parts of the work. <br>
<br>
The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can <br>
regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source. <br>
<br>
The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same <br>
work. <br>
<br>
<br>
2. Basic Permissions.<br>
<br>
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of <br>
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated <br>
conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited <br>
permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a <br>
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its <br>
content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your <br>
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law. <br>
<br>
You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, <br>
without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. <br>
You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having <br>
them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with <br>
facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the <br>
terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not <br>
control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for <br>
you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and <br>
control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your <br>
copyrighted material outside their relationship with you. <br>
<br>
Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the <br>
conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes <br>
it unnecessary. <br>
<br>
3. Protecting Users&#39; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br>
<br>
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological <br>
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 <br>
of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar <br>
laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures. <br>
<br>
When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid <br>
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention <br>
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the <br>
covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or <br>
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&#39;s <br>
users, your or third parties&#39; legal rights to forbid circumvention of <br>
technological measures. <br>
<br>
4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br>
<br>
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source code as you <br>
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and <br>
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep <br>
intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive <br>
terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all <br>
notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy <br>
of this License along with the Program. <br>
<br>
You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and <br>
you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee. <br>
<br>
5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br>
<br>
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to <br>
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms <br>
of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: <br>
<br>
<br>
 a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, <br>
    and giving a relevant date. <br>
 b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released <br>
    under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This <br>
    requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to &#34;keep intact<br>
    all notices&#34;. <br>
<br>
 c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to <br>
    anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will<br>
    therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional<br>
    terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of<br>
    how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license<br>
    the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such <br>
    permission if you have separately received it. <br>
<br>
 d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display <br>
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive <br>
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<br>
    work need not make them do so. <br>
<br>
A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent <br>
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and <br>
which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or <br>
on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an <br>
&#34;aggregate&#34; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not <br>
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users <br>
beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in <br>
an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of <br>
the aggregate. <br>
<br>
6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br>
<br>
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of <br>
sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable <br>
Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these <br>
ways: <br>
<br>
 a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product <br>
    including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the <br>
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<br>
    customarily used for software interchange. <br>
<br>
 b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product <br>
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<br>
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for <br>
    as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that<br>
    product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code <br>
    either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the <br>
    software in the product that is covered by this License, on a <br>
    durable physical medium customarily used for software <br>
    interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of<br>
    physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access<br>
    to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge. <br>
<br>
 c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the <br>
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative<br>
    is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you<br>
    received the object code with such an offer, in accord with <br>
    subsection 6b. <br>
<br>
 d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place <br>
    (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the <br>
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no <br>
    further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the <br>
    Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to<br>
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<br>
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) <br>
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br>
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br>
    Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the <br>
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is <br>
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements. <br>
<br>
 e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you <br>
    inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of<br>
    the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under <br>
    subsection 6d. <br>
<br>
A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded <br>
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included <br>
in conveying the object code work. <br>
<br>
A &#34;User Product&#34; is either (1) a &#34;consumer product&#34;, which means<br>
any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, <br>
family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for <br>
incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a <br>
consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. <br>
For a particular product received by a particular user, &#34;normally <br>
used&#34; refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, <br>
regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which <br>
the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the <br>
product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the <br>
product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, <br>
unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the <br>
product. <br>
<br>
&#34;Installation Information&#34; for a User Product means any methods, <br>
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install <br>
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product <br>
from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information <br>
must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified <br>
object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because <br>
modification has been made. <br>
<br>
If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or <br>
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as <br>
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the <br>
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a <br>
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the <br>
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by <br>
the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if <br>
neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified <br>
object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been <br>
installed in ROM). <br>
<br>
The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a <br>
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates <br>
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for <br>
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a <br>
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and <br>
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and <br>
protocols for communication across the network. <br>
<br>
Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in <br>
accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented <br>
(and with an implementation available to the public in source code <br>
form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, <br>
reading or copying. <br>
<br>
7. Additional Terms.<br>
<br>
&#34;Additional permissions&#34; are terms that supplement the terms of this <br>
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. <br>
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall <br>
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent <br>
that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions <br>
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately <br>
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this <br>
License without regard to the additional permissions. <br>
<br>
When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove <br>
any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. <br>
(Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in <br>
certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional <br>
permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you <br>
have or can give appropriate copyright permission. <br>
<br>
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you <br>
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders <br>
of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms: <br>
<br>
 a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the <br>
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or <br>
<br>
 b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or <br>
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<br>
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or <br>
<br>
 c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or <br>
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in <br>
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or <br>
<br>
 d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or <br>
    authors of the material; or e) Declining to grant rights under<br>
    trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service<br>
    marks; or <br>
<br>
 f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material <br>
    by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it)<br>
    with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any<br>
    liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<br>
    those licensors and authors. <br>
<br>
All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &#34;further <br>
restrictions&#34; within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you <br>
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is <br>
governed by this License along with a term that is a further <br>
restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a <br>
further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this <br>
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of <br>
that license document, provided that the further restriction does not <br>
survive such relicensing or conveying. <br>
<br>
If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must <br>
place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms <br>
that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the <br>
applicable terms. <br>
<br>
Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the <br>
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above <br>
requirements apply either way. <br>
<br>
8. Termination.<br>
<br>
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly <br>
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or <br>
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under <br>
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third <br>
paragraph of section 11). <br>
<br>
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license <br>
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, <br>
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates <br>
your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to <br>
notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days <br>
after the cessation. <br>
<br>
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated <br>
permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by <br>
some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice <br>
of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, <br>
and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the <br>
notice. <br>
<br>
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the <br>
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under <br>
this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently <br>
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same <br>
material under section 10. <br>
<br>
9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br>
<br>
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a <br>
copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring <br>
solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a <br>
copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than <br>
this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered <br>
work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this <br>
License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you <br>
indicate your acceptance of this License to do so. <br>
<br>
10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br>
<br>
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically <br>
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and <br>
propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible <br>
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. <br>
<br>
An &#34;entity transaction&#34; is a transaction transferring control of an <br>
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an <br>
organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work <br>
results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who <br>
receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work <br>
the party&#39;s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous <br>
paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the <br>
work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can <br>
get it with reasonable efforts. <br>
<br>
You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the <br>
rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not <br>
impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights <br>
granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation <br>
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any <br>
patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, <br>
or importing the Program or any portion of it. <br>
<br>
11. Patents.<br>
<br>
A &#34;contributor&#34; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this <br>
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work <br>
thus licensed is called the contributor&#39;s &#34;contributor version&#34;. <br>
<br>
A contributor&#39;s &#34;essential patent claims&#34; are all patent claims <br>
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or <br>
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by <br>
this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but <br>
do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of <br>
further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this <br>
definition, &#34;control&#34; includes the right to grant patent sublicenses <br>
in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License. <br>
<br>
Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free <br>
patent license under the contributor&#39;s essential patent claims, to make, <br>
use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and <br>
propagate the contents of its contributor version. <br>
<br>
In the following three paragraphs, a &#34;patent license&#34; is any express <br>
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent <br>
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to <br>
sue for patent infringement). To &#34;grant&#34; such a patent license to a <br>
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a <br>
patent against the party. <br>
<br>
If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and <br>
the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to <br>
copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a <br>
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, <br>
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so <br>
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the <br>
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner <br>
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent <br>
license to downstream recipients. &#34;Knowingly relying&#34; means you have <br>
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the <br>
covered work in a country, or your recipient&#39;s use of the covered work <br>
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that <br>
country that you have reason to believe are valid. <br>
<br>
If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or <br>
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a <br>
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties <br>
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or <br>
convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you <br>
grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work <br>
and works based on it. <br>
<br>
A patent license is &#34;discriminatory&#34; if it does not include within <br>
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned <br>
on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically <br>
granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are <br>
a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of <br>
distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party <br>
based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under <br>
which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive <br>
the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in <br>
connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies <br>
made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with <br>
specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless <br>
you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, <br>
prior to 28 March 2007. <br>
<br>
Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any <br>
implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be <br>
available to you under applicable patent law. <br>
<br>
12. No Surrender of Others&#39; Freedom.<br>
<br>
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or <br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not <br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a <br>
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this <br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you <br>
may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that <br>
obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to <br>
whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those <br>
terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the <br>
Program. <br>
<br>
13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<br>
<br>
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission <br>
to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 <br>
of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, <br>
and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will <br>
continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special <br>
requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, <br>
concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination <br>
as such. <br>
<br>
14. Revised Versions of this License.<br>
<br>
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of <br>
the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will <br>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to <br>
address new problems or concerns. <br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program <br>
specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public <br>
License &#34;or any later version&#34; applies to it, you have the option of <br>
following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of <br>
any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the <br>
Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public <br>
License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software <br>
Foundation. <br>
<br>
If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions <br>
of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&#39;s public <br>
statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to <br>
choose that version for the Program. <br>
<br>
Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. <br>
However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or <br>
copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version. <br>
<br>
15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br>
<br>
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY <br>
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT <br>
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &#34;AS IS&#34; WITHOUT <br>
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT <br>
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A <br>
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF <br>
THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME <br>
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. <br>
<br>
16. Limitation of Liability.<br>
<br>
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING <br>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR <br>
CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, <br>
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES <br>
ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT <br>
NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES <br>
SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE <br>
WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN <br>
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. <br>
<br>
17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br>
<br>
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above <br>
cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing <br>
courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute <br>
waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a <br>
warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in <br>
return for a fee. <br>

LIMITED LICENSE GRANTS<br>
<br>
1. License for Evaluation Purposes. Specification Lead hereby grants<br>
you a fully-paid, non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, limited<br>
license (without the right to sublicense), under Specification Lead&#39;s<br>
applicable intellectual property rights to view, download, use and<br>
reproduce the Specification only for the purpose of internal<br>
evaluation. This includes (i) developing applications intended to run<br>
on an implementation of the Specification, provided that such<br>
applications do not themselves implement any portion(s) of the<br>
Specification, and (ii) discussing the Specification with any third<br>
party; and (iii) excerpting brief portions of the Specification in oral<br>
or written communications which discuss the Specification provided that<br>
such excerpts do not in the aggregate constitute a significant portion<br>
of the Specification.<br>
<br>
2. License for the Distribution of Compliant Implementations.<br>
Specification Lead also grants you a perpetual, non-exclusive,<br>
non-transferable, worldwide, fully paid-up, royalty free, limited<br>
license (without the right to sublicense) under any applicable<br>
copyrights or, subject to the provisions of subsection 4 below, patent<br>
rights it may have covering the Specification to create and/or<br>
distribute an Independent Implementation of the Specification that: (a)<br>
fully implements the Specification including all its required<br>
interfaces and functionality; (b) does not modify, subset, superset or<br>
otherwise extend the Licensor Name Space, or include any public or<br>
protected packages, classes, Java interfaces, fields or methods within<br>
the Licensor Name Space other than those required/authorized by the<br>
Specification or Specifications being implemented; and (c) passes the<br>
Technology Compatibility Kit (including satisfying the requirements of<br>
the applicable TCK Users Guide) for such Specification (&#34;Compliant<br>
Implementation&#34;). In addition, the foregoing license is expressly<br>
conditioned on your not acting outside its scope. No license is<br>
granted hereunder for any other purpose (including, for example,<br>

requirements in any license You grant concerning the use of your<br>
Independent Implementation or products derived from it. However,<br>
except with respect to Independent Implementations (and products<br>
derived from them) that satisfy limitations (a)-(c) from the previous<br>
paragraph, You may neither: (a) grant or otherwise pass through to<br>
your licensees any licenses under Specification Lead&#39;s applicable<br>
intellectual property rights; nor (b) authorize your licensees to make<br>
any claims concerning their implementation&#39;s compliance with the<br>
Specification in question.<br>
<br>
4. Reciprocity Concerning Patent Licenses.<br>
<br>
a. With respect to any patent claims covered by the license granted<br>
under subparagraph 2 above that would be infringed by all technically<br>
feasible implementations of the Specification, such license is<br>
conditioned upon your offering on fair, reasonable and<br>
non-discriminatory terms, to any party seeking it from You, a<br>
perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide license under<br>
Your patent rights which are or would be infringed by all technically<br>
feasible implementations of the Specification to develop, distribute<br>
and use a Compliant Implementation.<br>
<br>
b. With respect to any patent claims owned by Specification Lead and<br>
covered by the license granted under subparagraph 2, whether or not<br>
their infringement can be avoided in a technically feasible manner when<br>
implementing the Specification, such license shall terminate with<br>
respect to such claims if You initiate a claim against Specification<br>
Lead that it has, in the course of performing its responsibilities as<br>
the Specification Lead, induced any other entity to infringe Your<br>
patent rights.<br>
<br>
c. Also with respect to any patent claims owned by Specification Lead<br>
and covered by the license granted under subparagraph 2 above, where<br>
the infringement of such claims can be avoided in a technically<br>
feasible manner when implementing the Specification such license, with<br>
respect to such claims, shall terminate if You initiate a claim against<br>
Specification Lead that its making, having made, using, offering to<br>
sell, selling or importing a Compliant Implementation infringes Your<br>
patent rights.<br>
<br>
5. Definitions. For the purposes of this Agreement: &#34;Independent<br>
Implementation&#34; shall mean an implementation of the Specification that<br>
neither derives from any of Specification Lead&#39;s source code or binary<br>
code materials nor, except with an appropriate and separate license<br>
from Specification Lead, includes any of Specification Lead&#39;s source<br>
code or binary code materials; &#34;Licensor Name Space&#34; shall mean the<br>
public class or interface declarations whose names begin with &#34;java&#34;,<br>
&#34;javax&#34;, &#34;com.sun&#34; and &#34;com.oracle&#34; or their equivalents in any<br>
subsequent naming convention adopted by Oracle America, Inc. through<br>
the Java Community Process, or any recognized successors or<br>
replacements thereof; and &#34;Technology Compatibility Kit&#34; or &#34;TCK&#34; shall<br>
mean the test suite and accompanying TCK User&#39;s Guide provided by<br>
Specification Lead which corresponds to the Specification and that was<br>
available either (i) from Specification Lead&#39;s 120 days before the<br>
first release of Your Independent Implementation that allows its use<br>
for commercial purposes, or (ii) more recently than 120 days from such<br>
release but against which You elect to test Your implementation of the<br>
Specification.<br>
This Agreement will terminate immediately without notice from<br>

of the licenses granted above.<br>
