<br>
Two license agreements are presented below.<br>
<br>
1. IBM International License Agreement for Evaluation of 
Programs<br>
2. IBM International Program License Agreement<br>
<br>
If Licensee is obtaining the Program for purposes of 
productive use (other than evaluation, testing, trial "try or buy," or 
demonstration): By clicking on the "Accept" button below, Licensee accepts 
the IBM International Program License Agreement, without 
modification.<br>
<br>
If Licensee is obtaining the Program for the purpose of 
evaluation, testing, trial "try or buy," or demonstration 
(collectively, an "Evaluation"): By clicking on the "Accept" button below, 
Licensee accepts both (i) the IBM International License Agreement 
for Evaluation of Programs (the "Evaluation License"), without 
modification; and (ii) the IBM International Program License Agreement 
(the "IPLA"), without modification.<br>
<br>
The Evaluation License will apply during the term of 
Licensee's Evaluation.<br>
<br>
The IPLA will automatically apply if Licensee elects to 
retain the Program after the Evaluation (or obtain additional 
copies of the Program for use after the Evaluation) by entering 
into a procurement agreement (e.g., the IBM International 
Passport Advantage or the IBM Passport Advantage Express agreements).<br>
<br>
The Evaluation License and the IPLA are not in effect 
concurrently; neither modifies the other; and each is independent of the 
other.<br>
<br>
The complete text of each of these two license agreements 
follow.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
LICENSE INFORMATION<br>
<br>
The Programs listed below are licensed under the following 
License Information terms and conditions in addition to the Program 
license terms previously agreed to by Client and IBM. If Client 
does not have previously agreed to license terms in effect for 
the Program, the International License Agreement for Evaluation 
of Programs (i125-5543-06) applies.<br>
<br>
Program Name (Program Number):<br>
IBM WebSphere Application Server V9.0.5.11 (Evaluation)<br>
<br>
The following standard terms apply to Licensee's use of the 
Program.<br>
<br>
Evaluation Period<br>
<br>
The evaluation period begins on the date that Licensee 
agrees to the terms of this Agreement and ends after 60 days.<br>
<br>
Supporting Programs<br>
<br>
Licensee is authorized to install and use the Supporting 
Programs identified below only to support Licensee's use of the 
Principal Program under this Agreement. The phrase "to support 
Licensee's use" would only include those uses that are necessary or 
otherwise directly related to a licensed use of the Principal Program 
or another Supporting Program. The Supporting Programs may not 
be used for any other purpose. A Supporting Program may be 
accompanied by license terms, and those terms, if any, apply to 
Licensee's use of that Supporting Program. In the event of conflict, 
the terms in this License Information document supersede the 
Supporting Program's terms. Licensee must obtain sufficient 
entitlements to the Program, as a whole, to cover Licensee's 
installation and use of all of the Supporting Programs, unless separate 
entitlements are provided within this License Information document. For 
example, if this Program were licensed on a VPC (Virtual Processor 
Core) basis and Licensee were to install the Principal Program or 
a Supporting Program on a 10 VPC machine and another 
Supporting Program on a second 10 VPC machine, Licensee would be 
required to obtain 20 VPC entitlements to the Program.<br>

EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE WARRANTY OF TITLE, NON-
INFRINGEMENT OR NON-INTERFERENCE AND THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND 
CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.<br>
<br>
The following units of measure may apply to Licensee's use 
of the Program.<br>
<br>
Limited Use Socket<br>
<br>
Limited Use Socket is a unit of measure by which the 
Program can be licensed. A socket is electronic circuitry that 
accepts a processor chip. A server is a physical computer that is 
comprised of processing units, memory, and input/output capabilities 
and that executes requested procedures, commands, or 
applications for one or more users or client devices. Where racks, blade 
enclosures, or other similar equipment is being employed, each 
separable physical device (for example, a blade or a rack-mounted 
device) that has the required components is considered itself a 
separate server. A virtual server is either a virtual computer 
created by partitioning the resources available to a physical 
server that complies with the requirements of the Sub-capacity 
Guide found at ftp://ftp.software.ibm.
com/software/smb/pdfs/SubcapacityGuide.pdf or the unpartitioned physical server. If Licensee's 
virtualization environment does not comply with the requirements of the 
Sub-capacity Guide, the entire physical server must meet all 
requirements in this license. Licensee must obtain Limited Use Socket 
entitlements for each socket on the virtual servers made available to 
the Program. The total number of sockets on any virtual server 
made available to the Program cannot exceed 4.<br>
<br>
Processor Value Unit (PVU)<br>
<br>
Processor Value Unit (PVU) is a unit of measure by which 
the Program can be licensed. The number of PVU entitlements 
required is based on the processor technology (defined within the 
Processor Value Unit (PVU) licensing for Distributed Software website 
at https://supportcontent.ibm.com/support/pages/ibm-processor-
value-unit-pvu-licensing-distributed-software) and the number of 
processors made available to the Program. IBM continues to define a 
processor, for the purpose of PVU-based licensing, to be each 
processor core on a chip. A dual-core processor chip, for example, 
has two processor cores.<br>
<br>
Licensee can deploy the Program (if supported) using full 
capacity licensing, sub-capacity licensing (https://www.ibm.
com/software/passportadvantage/subcaplicensing.html), or container licensing (https://www.ibm.
com/software/passportadvantage/containerlicenses.html). See the linked websites for more information.<br>
<br>
Virtual Processor Core<br>
<br>
Virtual Processor Core is a unit of measure by which the 
Program can be licensed. A Physical Server is a physical computer 
that is comprised of processing units, memory, and input/output 
capabilities and that executes requested procedures, commands, or 
applications for one or more users or client devices. Where racks, blade 
enclosures, or other similar equipment is being employed, each 
separable physical device (for example, a blade or a rack-mounted 
device) that has the required components is considered itself a 
separate Physical Server. A Virtual Server is either a virtual 
computer created by partitioning the resources available to a 
Physical Server or an unpartitioned Physical Server. A Processor 
Core is a functional unit within a computing device that 
interprets and executes instructions. A Processor Core consists of at 
least one instruction control unit and one or more arithmetic or 
logic units. A Virtual Processor Core is a Processor Core in an 
unpartitioned Physical Server, or a virtual core assigned to a Virtual 
Server. Licensee must obtain entitlements for each Virtual 
Processor Core made available to the Program.<br>
<br>
Licensee can deploy the Program (if supported) using full 
capacity licensing, sub-capacity licensing (https://www.ibm.
com/software/passportadvantage/subcaplicensing.html), or container licensing (https://www.ibm.
com/software/passportadvantage/containerlicenses.html). See the linked websites for more information. <br>
<br>
In addition to the above, the following terms apply to 
Licensee's use of the Program.<br>
<br>
Authorized User Single Install Pricing Option<br>
<br>
For Authorized User Single Install entitlements acquired by 
Licensee for the Program, Licensee can use the Program only on a 
single virtual or physical machine per Customer Location. A 
Customer Location is defined as a single physical site, including 
the surrounding campus and satellite offices located within one 
kilometer of that physical site.<br>
<br>
<br>
1. Components Not Used for Establishing Required 
Entitlements<br>
<br>
 Licensee may install and use the following Program 
components, under the license terms, but these components are not used 
to determine the number of entitlements required for the

Use of the Program on a Developer Machine for development 
and unit test purposes.<br>
<br>
A Developer Machine is defined as a physical or virtual 
desktop environment, running a primary operating system and the 
Program, both of which are accessible and used by no more than one 
(1) specified developer. The physical or virtual desktop 
environments include on-premises and off-premises cloud environments. 
The Program and these component(s) cannot be used for 
production purposes, including processing production workloads, 
simulating production workloads or testing scalability of any code, 
application or system. Licensee is not authorized to use any part of 
the Program component(s) for any other purposes without 
acquiring the appropriate production entitlements.<br>
<br>
Use as a Build Server<br>
<br>
A Build Server is defined as a machine, physical or 
virtual, in which the Program is installed but has not been started 
with the exception of the server package command, the Program 
libraries can be used for Program application and server builds in 
support of the licensed Program.<br>
<br>
2. Other IBM Application Server Solutions <br>
<br>
Licensee is authorized to use the Job Manager and 
Collective Controller components of WebSphere Application Server 
Network Deployment to manage the Program. Licensee is not 
authorized to use any other components of WebSphere Application Server 
Network Deployment to manage the Program.<br>
<br>
3. HTTP Load Balancing and Failover <br>
<br>
Licensee is entitled to use the Web server plug-ins to 
improve security by having an HTTP server run on a separate machine 
from the Program. <br>
<br>
Licensee is authorized to configure the Web server plug-ins 
for an unlimited number of Profiles of the Program for the 
purposes of simple load balancing and failover, and is limited to 
HTTP/HTTPS requests only. A Profile of the Program is defined as an 
individual WebSphere Application Server runtime environment and 
includes all the files that the server processes in the runtime 
environment and that a Licensee can change. <br>
<br>
Supporting Program Details<br>
<br>

<br>
This International License Agreement for Evaluation of 
Programs (ILAE) and applicable Transaction Documents (together the 
"Agreement") are the complete agreement between Licensee and IBM 
regarding the use of a Program. The country required terms included 
in Part 2 of this ILAE replace or modify the terms of Part 1.<br>
<br>
Transaction Documents (TDs) provide a description, 
information, and terms regarding the Program and its authorized use. 
Examples of TDs for Programs include license information (LI), 
licensed program specifications (LPS), quote, proof of entitlement 
(PoE), or invoice. To the extent of any conflict a TD will prevail 
over the ILAE.<br>
<br>
1. Program License<br>
<br>
a. A Program is an executable IBM-branded computer program 
and its related material and includes whole and partial copies. 
Program details are described in a TD available at http://www.ibm.
com/software/sla (for Passport Advantage Programs) or http://www.ibm.
com/support/knowledgecenter (for other IBM Programs), in the Program's system command 
directory, or as otherwise specified by IBM. IBM software policies 
(such as backup, temporary use and IBM approved cloud 
environment) available at http://www.ibm.com/softwarepolicies apply to 
Licensee's use of Programs.<br>
<br>
b. Copies of Programs are copyrighted and licensed.<br>
<br>
c. Licensee is granted a nonexclusive limited license to:<br>
<br>
(1) use each copy of a Program solely for internal 
evaluation, testing, or demonstration purposes on a trial basis during 
the Evaluation Period (as defined in the applicable Program TD) 
("Authorized Use");<br>
<br>
(2) make and install copies to support such Authorized Use; 
and<br>
<br>
(3) make a backup copy.<br>
<br>
d. Programs may be used by Licensee, its employees and 
contractors. Licensee may not use the Program for productive purposes, 
rent or lease a Program, or provide commercial IT, hosting or 
timesharing services to any third party. Additional rights may be 
available for additional fees or under different terms.<br>
<br>
e. The license granted for a Program is subject to Licensee:<br>
<br>
(1) reproducing copyright notices and other markings on any 
copy;<br>
<br>
(2) ensuring anyone who uses the Program: i) does so only 
on Licensee's behalf within Licensee's Authorized Use; and ii) 
complies with this Agreement;<br>
<br>
(3) not disabling any disabling device, reverse assembling, 
reverse compiling, translating, or reverse engineering the Program, 
except as expressly permitted by law without the possibility of 
contractual waiver; and<br>
<br>
(4) not using any of the elements of the Program or related 
licensed materials separately from the Program.<br>
<br>
f. If the TD for a Program ("Principal Program") states 
that a "Supporting Program" is included with the Principal 
Program, Licensee may use the Supporting Program subject to any 
license limitations of the Principal Program and only to support 
the Principal Program.<br>
<br>
g. This license applies to each copy of the Program that 
Licensee makes.<br>
<br>
h. An update, fix, or patch to a Program is subject to the 
terms governing the Program unless new terms are provided in an 
updated TD. Licensee accepts such new terms upon installation of 
the update, fix, or patch. If a Program is replaced by an 
update, Licensee agrees to promptly discontinue use of the replaced 
Program.<br>
<br>
2. Warranties<br>
<br>
a. Subject to applicable laws, Programs are provided as-is, 
with no warranties of any kind, including: i) no warranty for 
uninterrupted or error-free operation of the Program; or ii) no other 
warranties such as implied warranties or conditions of satisfactory 
quality, merchantability, non-infringement, and fitness for a 
particular purpose.<br>
<br>
b. IBM does not provide any support, unless otherwise 
specified in a TD.<br>
<br>
3. Charges, Taxes, Payment, and Verification<br>
<br>
a. There are no charges for use of a Program during the 
Evaluation Period, unless specified otherwise by IBM. If any authority 
imposes a custom, duty, tax (including withholding tax), levy or 
fee for the import or export, transfer, access or use of the 
Program, then Licensee is responsible to pay any such amount imposed.<br>
<br>
b. If Licensee imports, exports, transfers, accesses, or 
uses a Program across a border, Licensee agrees to be 
responsible for and pay authorities any custom, duty, tax, or similar 
levy assessed by the authorities. This excludes those taxes 
based on IBM's net income.<br>
<br>
3.1 Licensing Verification<br>
<br>
a. Licensee will, for all Programs at all sites and for all 
environments, create, retain, and provide to IBM upon request with 30 
days' advance notice: i) a report, in a format requested by IBM 
using records, system tools output, and other system information; 
and ii) supporting documentation (collectively, "Deployment 
Data").<br>
<br>
b. Upon reasonable notice, IBM and its independent auditors 
may verify Licensee's compliance with this Agreement, at all 
sites and for all environments in which Licensee uses (for any 
purposes) Programs. Verification will be conducted in a manner that 
minimizes disruption to Licensee's business and may be conducted on 
Licensee's premises, during normal business hours. IBM will have a 
written confidentiality agreement with the independent auditor. In 
addition to providing Deployment Data described above, Licensee 
agrees to provide to IBM and its auditors additional accurate 
information and Deployment Data upon request.<br>
<br>
c. Licensee will promptly order and pay charges at IBM's 
then current rates associated with: i) any deployments or use in 
excess of authorizations or in violation of this agreement 
indicated on or by any verification; ii) applicable subscription & 
support services (S&S) for such excess deployments for the lesser 
of the duration of such excess use or two years; and iii) any 
additional charges and other liabilities determined as a result of 
such verification, including but not limited to taxes, duties, 
and regulatory fees.<br>
<br>
4. Liability<br>

a. IBM's entire liability for all claims related to the 
Agreement will not exceed the amount of any actual direct damages 
incurred by Licensee up to the greater of: i) U.S. $10,000.00 (or 
equivalent in local currency); or ii) the amounts paid (if recurring 
charges, up to 12 months' charges apply) for the entitlements to the 
Program that is the subject of the claim, regardless of the basis 
of the claim. IBM will not be liable for special, incidental, 
exemplary, indirect, or economic consequential damages, or for lost 
profits, business, value, revenue, goodwill, or anticipated savings. 
These limitations apply collectively to IBM, its affiliates, 
contractors, and suppliers.<br>
<br>
b. The following amounts are not subject to the above cap: 
damages that cannot be limited under applicable law.<br>
<br>
c. IBM has no responsibility for claims based on non-IBM 
products, items not provided by IBM, or any violation of law or third 
party rights caused by Content, or any Licensee materials, 
designs, specifications. Content consists of all data, software, and 
information that Licensee or its authorized users provide, authorize 
access to, or inputs to a Program.<br>
<br>
5. Termination<br>
<br>
a. The Evaluation Period begins on the date Licensee agrees 
to the terms of this Agreement and ends upon the earliest of: 
i) the date specified in the applicable TD; or ii) the date on 
which the Program automatically disables itself. Licensee will 
destroy the Program and all copies made of it within ten days of 
the end of the Evaluation Period. Licensee is responsible to 
remove any Content prior to expiration of the Evaluation Period as 
any disabling device may prevent use upon expiration.<br>
<br>
b. If IBM specifies in a TD that Licensee may retain the 
Program, and Licensee elects to do so, then the Program will be 
subject to a different license agreement, which IBM will provide to 
Licensee. In addition, a charge may apply.<br>
<br>
c. IBM may terminate Licensee's license to use a Program if 
Licensee fails to comply with the ILAE, TDs or acquisition 
agreements, such as the International Passport Advantage Agreement 
(IPAA). Licensee will promptly destroy all copies of the Program 
after license termination. Any terms that by their nature extend 
beyond the termination remain in effect until fulfilled and apply 
to successors and assignees.<br>
<br>
6. Governing Laws and Geographic Scope<br>
<br>
a. Both parties agree to the application of the laws of the 
country where the transaction for license entitlements is 
performed, without regard to conflict of law principles. The rights 
and obligations of each party are valid only in the country 
where the transaction to acquire license entitlements is 
performed or, if IBM agrees, the country where the Program is placed 
in productive use, except all licenses are valid as 
specifically granted.<br>
<br>
b. Each party is also responsible for complying with: i) 
laws and regulations applicable to its business and Content; and 
ii) import, export and economic sanction laws and regulations, 
including the defense trade control regime of the United States of 
America and any applicable jurisdictions, that prohibit or restrict 
the import, export, re-export, or transfer of products, 
technology, services or data, directly or indirectly, to or for certain 
countries, end uses or end users.<br>
<br>
c. If any provision of this Agreement for a Program, is 
invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in full 
force and effect. Nothing in this Agreement affects statutory 
rights of consumers that cannot be waived or limited by contract. 
The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the 
International Sale of Goods does not apply to transactions under this 
Agreement.<br>
<br>
7. General<br>
<br>
a. IBM is an independent contractor, not Licensee's agent, 
joint venturer, partner, or fiduciary, and does not undertake to 
perform any of Licensee's regulatory obligations, or assume any 
responsibility for Licensee's business or operations. Licensee is 
responsible for its use of IBM Programs and Non-IBM Programs. IBM is 
acting as an information technology provider only. IBM's 
direction, suggested usage, or guidance or use of a Program does not 
constitute medical, clinical, legal, accounting, or other licensed 
professional advice. Licensee should obtain its own expert advice.<br>
<br>
b. For Programs IBM provides to Licensee in tangible form, 
IBM fulfills its shipping and delivery obligations upon the 
delivery of such Programs to the IBM-designated carrier, unless 
otherwise agreed to in writing by Licensee and IBM.<br>
<br>
c. Licensee may not use the Program if failure of the 
Program could lead to death, serious bodily injury, or property or 
environmental damage.<br>
<br>
d. IBM, its affiliates, and contractors of either require 
use of business contact information and certain account usage 
information. This information is not Content. Business contact 
information is used to communicate and manage business dealings with 
the Licensee. Examples of business contact information include 
name, business telephone, address, email, user ID, and tax 
registration information. Account usage information is required to 
enable, provide, manage, support, administer, and improve Programs. 
Examples of account usage information include reported errors and 
digital information gathered using tracking technologies, such as 
cookies and web beacons, during use of the Programs. The IBM 
Privacy Statement at https://www.ibm.com/privacy/ provides 
additional details with respect to IBM's collection, use, and handling 
of business contact and account usage information. When 
Licensee provides information to IBM and notice to, or consent by, 
the individuals is required for such processing, Licensee will 
notify individuals and obtain consent.<br>
<br>
e. IBM Business Partners who use or make available Programs 
are independent from IBM and unilaterally determine their 
prices and terms. IBM is not responsible for their actions, 
omissions, statements, or offerings.<br>
<br>
f. IBM may offer Non-IBM Programs, or an IBM Program may 
enable access to Non-IBM Programs, that may require acceptance of 
third party terms identified in a TD or presented to the 
Licensee. Linking to or use of Non-IBM Programs constitutes 
Licensee's agreement with such terms. IBM is not a party to such third 
party agreements and is not responsible for such Non-IBM Programs.<br>
<br>
g. License grants to Programs are provided by International 
Business Machines Corporation, a New York corporation ("IBM 
Corporation"). The IBM company from which the Licensee acquires 
entitlements ("IBM") is acting as a distributor and delivering Programs 
and is responsible for enforcing the terms of this Agreement. 
If entitlements are acquired from an IBM Business Partner, the 
IBM company for the country of acquisition is responsible for 
enforcing the terms of this Agreement. No right or cause of action is 
created in favor of Licensee against IBM Corporation. Licensee 
waives all claims and causes of action against IBM Corporation and 
agrees to look solely to IBM for any rights and remedies in 
connection with Programs.<br>
<br>
h. Licensee may not sublicense, assign, or transfer the 
license for any Program (except to the extent assignment or 
transfer may not be legally restricted or as is expressly permitted 
in a TD or as otherwise agreed by IBM). IBM may assign its 
rights and obligations under this Agreement in conjunction with 
the sale of the portion of IBM's business that includes a 
Program. IBM may share this Agreement and related documents in 
conjunction with any assignment.<br>
<br>
i. All notices under the Agreement must be in writing and 
sent to the business address specified in the agreement Licensee 
acquired the license entitlements unless a party designates in 
writing a different address. The parties consent to the use of 
electronic means and facsimile transmissions for communications as a 
signed writing. Any reproduction of the Agreement made by reliable 
means is considered an original. Agreement supersedes any course 
of dealing, discussions or representations, between the 
parties.<br>
<br>
j. No right or cause of action for any third party is 
created by the Agreement. Neither party will bring a legal action 
arising out of or related to the Agreement more than two years 
after the cause of action arose. Neither party is responsible for 
failure to fulfill its non-monetary obligations due to causes 
beyond its control. Each party will allow the other reasonable 
opportunity to comply before it claims the other has not met its 
obligations.<br>
<br>
k. IBM may use personnel and resources in locations 
worldwide, including third party contractors to support the delivery 
of Programs and Program support. Licensee's use of Programs 
may result in the transfer of Content, including personally 
identifiable information, across country borders to provide Program 
support as described in the IBM Software Support Guide.<br>

International Program License Agreement<br>
<br>
Part 1 - General Terms<br>
<br>
BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, COPYING, ACCESSING, CLICKING ON 
AN "ACCEPT" BUTTON, OR OTHERWISE USING THE PROGRAM, LICENSEE 
AGREES TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE ACCEPTING THESE 
TERMS ON BEHALF OF LICENSEE, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE FULL 
AUTHORITY TO BIND LICENSEE TO THESE TERMS.<br>
<br>
IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS OR DO NOT HAVE 
AUTHORITY: i) DO NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, COPY, ACCESS, CLICK ON AN

<br>
This International Program License Agreement (IPLA) and 
applicable Transaction Documents (together the "Agreement") are the 
complete agreement between Licensee and IBM regarding the use of a 
Program. The country required terms included in Part 2 of this IPLA 
replace or modify the terms of Part 1.<br>
<br>
Transaction Documents (TDs) provide a description, 
information, and terms regarding the Program and its authorized use. 
Examples of TDs for Programs include license information (LI), 
licensed program specifications (LPS), quote, proof of entitlement 
(PoE), or invoice. To the extent of any conflict a TD will prevail 
over the IPLA.<br>
<br>
1. Program License<br>
<br>
a. A Program is an executable IBM-branded computer program 
and its related material and includes whole and partial copies. 
Program details are described in a TD available at http://www.ibm.
com/software/sla (for Passport Advantage Programs) or http://www.ibm.
com/support/knowledgecenter (for other IBM Programs), in the Program's system command 
directory, or as otherwise specified by IBM. IBM software policies 
(such as backup, temporary use and IBM approved cloud 
environment) available at http://www.ibm.com/softwarepolicies apply to 
Licensee's use of Programs.<br>
<br>
b. Copies of Programs are copyrighted and licensed.<br>
<br>
c. Licensee is granted a nonexclusive license to:<br>
<br>
(1) use each copy of a Program, subject to the terms of the 
Agreement and up to the number of license entitlements Licensee 
acquires ("Authorized Use");<br>
<br>
(2) make and install copies to support such Authorized Use; 
and<br>
<br>
(3) make a backup copy.<br>
<br>
d. Programs may be used by Licensee, its employees and 
contractors. Licensee may not rent or lease a Program or provide 
commercial IT, hosting or timesharing services to any third party. 
Additional rights may be available for additional fees or under 
different terms.<br>
<br>
e. The license granted for a Program is subject to Licensee:<br>
<br>
(1) reproducing copyright notices and other markings on any 
copy;<br>
<br>
(2) ensuring anyone who uses the Program: i) does so only 
on Licensee's behalf within Licensee's Authorized Use; and ii) 
complies with this Agreement;<br>
<br>
(3) not reverse assembling, reverse compiling, translating, 
or reverse engineering the Program, except as expressly 
permitted by law without the possibility of contractual waiver; and<br>
<br>
(4) not using any of the elements of the Program or related 
licensed materials separately from the Program.<br>
<br>
f. If the TD for a Program ("Principal Program") states 
that a "Supporting Program" is included with the Principal 
Program, Licensee may use the Supporting Program subject to any 
license limitations of the Principal Program and only to support 
the Principal Program.<br>
<br>
g. This license applies to each copy of the Program that 
Licensee makes.<br>
<br>
h. An update, fix, or patch to a Program is subject to the 
terms governing the Program unless new terms are provided in an 
updated TD. Licensee accepts such new terms upon installation of 
the update, fix, or patch. If a Program is replaced by an 
update, Licensee agrees to promptly discontinue use of the replaced 
Program.<br>
<br>
i. If Licensee is dissatisfied with a Program for any 
reason, Licensee may terminate the license by returning the Program 
and proof of entitlement to IBM or the authorized IBM Business 
Partner within 30 days of the original acquisition date of such 
Program for a refund of the amount paid. For a downloaded Program, 
contact the party Licensee acquired the Program from for refund 
instructions.<br>
<br>
2. Warranties<br>
<br>
a. IBM warrants that a Program, when used in its specified 
operating environment conforms to its specifications. The warranty 
period for a Program is 12 months from acquisition, or the initial 
license term if less than 12 months, unless another warranty period 
is specified in the TD.<br>
<br>
b. During the warranty period Licensee will have access to 
IBM databases containing information on known Program defects, 
defect corrections, restrictions, and bypasses as described in the 
IBM Support Guide at http://www.ibm.
com/support/pages/node/733923.<br>
<br>
c. If the Program does not function as warranted during its 
warranty period and the problem cannot be resolved with information 
available in the IBM databases, Licensee may return the Program and 
proof of entitlement to IBM or the IBM Business Partner for a 
refund of the amount Licensee paid and Licensee's license 
terminates.<br>
<br>
d. IBM does not warrant uninterrupted or error-free 
operation of an IBM Program or that IBM will correct all defects or 
prevent third party disruptions. These warranties are the exclusive 
warranties from IBM and replace all other warranties, including the 
implied warranties or conditions of satisfactory quality, 
merchantability, non-infringement, and fitness for a particular purpose. IBM 
warranties will not apply if there has been misuse, modification, 
damage not caused by IBM, or failure to comply with written 
instructions provided by IBM. Non-IBM Programs are provided as-is, 
without warranties of any kind. Third parties may provide their own 
warranties to Licensee.<br>
<br>
e. Additional support available during or after the 
warranty period may be available under separate agreement.<br>
<br>
3. Charges, Taxes, Payment, and Verification<br>
<br>
a. Licensee's right to use a Program is contingent on 
Licensee paying applicable charges as specified in the agreement 
under which Licensee acquired the license entitlements. Licensee 
is responsible to acquire additional license entitlements in 
advance of any increase of its use.<br>
<br>
b. Licensee agrees to pay all applicable charges for 
acquired entitlements and any charges for use in excess of 
authorizations. Charges are exclusive of any customs or other duty, tax, 
and similar levies imposed by any authority resulting from 
Licensee's acquisition of entitlements and will be invoiced in 
addition to such charges. Amounts are due upon receipt of the 
invoice from IBM and payable within 30 days of the invoice date to 
an account specified by IBM and late payment fees may apply. 
Licensee is responsible to properly acquire additional license 
entitlements in advance to increase its use. IBM does not give credits 
or refunds for charges already due or paid, except as 
specified elsewhere in this IPLA, the applicable TD, or terms of the 
agreement under which Licensee acquired license entitlements.<br>
<br>
c. Based on acquired entitlements, Licensee agrees to: i) 
pay any withholding tax directly to the appropriate government 
entity where required by law; ii) furnish a tax certificate 
evidencing such payment to IBM; iii) pay IBM only the net proceeds 
after tax; and iv) fully cooperate with IBM in seeking a waiver 
or reduction of such taxes and promptly complete and file all 
relevant documents.<br>
<br>
d. If Licensee imports, exports, transfers, accesses, or 
uses a Program across a border, Licensee agrees to be 
responsible for and pay authorities any custom, duty, tax, or similar 
levy assessed by the authorities. This excludes those taxes 
based on IBM's net income.<br>
<br>
3.1 Licensing Verification<br>
<br>
a. Licensee will, for all Programs at all sites and for all 
environments, create, retain, and each year provide to IBM upon request 
with 30 days' advance notice: i) a report, in a format requested 
by IBM using records, system tools output, and other system 
information; and ii) supporting documentation (collectively, "Deployment 
Data").<br>
<br>
b. Upon reasonable notice, IBM and its independent auditors 
may verify Licensee's compliance with this Agreement, at all 
sites and for all environments, in which Licensee uses (for any 
purposes) Programs. Verification will be conducted in a manner that 
minimizes disruption to Licensee's business and may be conducted on 
Licensee's premises, during normal business hours. IBM will have a 
written confidentiality agreement with the independent auditor. In 
addition to providing Deployment Data described above, Licensee 
agrees to provide to IBM and its auditors additional accurate 
information and Deployment Data upon request.<br>
<br>
c. Licensee will promptly order and pay charges at IBM's 
then current rates associated with: i) any deployments in excess 
of authorizations indicated on or by any annual report or 
verification; ii) applicable subscription & support services (S&S) for 
such excess deployments for the lesser of the duration of such 
excess use or two years; and iii) any additional charges and other 
liabilities determined as a result of such verification, including but 
not limited to taxes, duties, and regulatory fees.<br>
<br>
4. Liability and Intellectual Property Protection<br>
<br>
a. IBM's entire liability for all claims related to this 
Agreement will not exceed the amount of any actual direct damages 
incurred by Licensee up to the amounts paid (if recurring charges, 
up to 12 months' charges apply) for the entitlements to the 
Program that is the subject of the claim, regardless of the basis 
of the claim. IBM will not be liable for special, incidental, 
exemplary, indirect, or economic consequential damages, or for lost 
profits, business, value, revenue, goodwill, or anticipated savings. 
These limitations apply collectively to IBM, its affiliates, 
contractors, and suppliers.<br>
<br>
b. The following amounts are not subject to the above cap: 
i) third party payments related to infringement claims 
described in clause 4 c below; and ii) damages that cannot be limited 
under applicable law.<br>
<br>
c. If a third party asserts a claim against Licensee that 
an IBM Program infringes a patent or copyright, IBM will 
defend Licensee against that claim and pay amounts finally awarded 
by a court against Licensee or included in a settlement 
approved by IBM. To obtain IBM's defense against and payment of 
infringement claims, Licensee must promptly: i) notify IBM in writing of 
the claim; ii) supply information requested by IBM; and iii) 
allow IBM to control, and reasonably cooperate in, the defense 
and settlement, including mitigation efforts. IBM's defense and 
payment obligations for infringement claims extend to claims of 
infringement based on open source code that IBM selects and embeds in an 
IBM Program.<br>
<br>
d. IBM has no responsibility for claims based on non-IBM 
products, items not provided by IBM, or any violation of law or third 
party rights caused by Content, or any Licensee materials, 
designs, specifications, or use of a non-current version or release 
of an IBM Program when an infringement claim could have been 
avoided by using a current version or release. Content consists of 
all data, software, and information that Licensee or its 
authorized users provide, authorize access to, or inputs to a Program.<br>
<br>
5. Termination<br>
<br>
a. IBM may terminate Licensee's license to use a Program if 
Licensee fails to comply with the IPLA, TDs or acquisition 
agreements, such as the International Passport Advantage Agreement 
(IPAA). Licensee will promptly destroy all copies of the Program 
after license termination. Any terms that by their nature extend 
beyond the termination remain in effect until fulfilled and apply 
to successors and assignees.<br>
<br>
6. Governing Laws and Geographic Scope<br>
<br>
a. Both parties agree to the application of the laws of the 
country where the transaction for license entitlements is 
performed, without regard to conflict of law principles. The rights 
and obligations of each party are valid only in the country 
where the transaction to acquire license entitlements is 
performed or, if IBM agrees, the country where the Program is placed 
in productive use, except all licenses are valid as 
specifically granted.<br>
<br>
b. Each party is also responsible for complying with: i) 
laws and regulations applicable to its business and Content; and 
ii) import, export and economic sanction laws and regulations, 
including the defense trade control regime of the United States of 
America and any applicable jurisdictions, that prohibit or restrict 
the import, export, re-export, or transfer of products, 
technology, services or data, directly or indirectly, to or for certain 
countries, end uses or end users.<br>
<br>
c. If any provision of this Agreement for a Program, is 
invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in full 
force and effect. Nothing in this Agreement affects statutory 
rights of consumers that cannot be waived or limited by contract. 
The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the 
International Sale of Goods does not apply to transactions under this 
Agreement.<br>
<br>
7. General<br>
<br>
a. IBM is an independent contractor, not Licensee's agent, 
joint venturer, partner, or fiduciary, and does not undertake to 
perform any of Licensee's regulatory obligations, or assume any 
responsibility for Licensee's business or operations. Licensee is 
responsible for its use of IBM Programs and Non-IBM Programs. IBM is 
acting as an information technology provider only. IBM's 
direction, suggested usage, or guidance or use of a Program does not 
constitute medical, clinical, legal, accounting, or other licensed 
professional advice. Licensee should obtain its own expert advice.<br>
<br>
b. For Programs IBM provides to Licensee in tangible form, 
IBM fulfills its shipping and delivery obligations upon the 
delivery of such Programs to the IBM-designated carrier, unless 
otherwise agreed to in writing by Licensee and IBM.<br>
<br>
c. Licensee may not use the Program if failure of the 
Program could lead to death, serious bodily injury, or property or 
environmental damage.<br>
<br>
d. IBM, its affiliates, and contractors of either require 
use of business contact information and certain account usage 
information. This information is not Content. Business contact 
information is used to communicate and manage business dealings with 
the Licensee. Examples of business contact information include 
name, business telephone, address, email, user ID, and tax 
registration information. Account usage information is required to 
enable, provide, manage, support, administer, and improve Programs. 
Examples of account usage information include reported errors and 
digital information gathered using tracking technologies, such as 
cookies and web beacons, during use of the Programs. The IBM 
Privacy Statement at http://www.ibm.com/privacy provides additional 
details with respect to IBM's collection, use, and handling of 
business contact and account usage information. When Licensee 
provides information to IBM and notice to, or consent by, the 
individuals is required for such processing, Licensee will notify 
individuals and obtain consent.<br>
<br>
e. IBM Business Partners who use or make available Programs 
are independent from IBM and unilaterally determine their 
prices and terms. IBM is not responsible for their actions, 
omissions, statements, or offerings.<br>
<br>
f. IBM may offer Non-IBM Programs, or an IBM Program may 
enable access to Non-IBM Programs, that may require acceptance of 
third party terms identified in a TD or presented to the 
Licensee. Linking to or use of Non-IBM Programs constitutes 
Licensee's agreement with such terms. IBM is not a party to any third 
party agreement and is not responsible for such Non-IBM Programs.<br>
<br>
g. License grants to Programs are provided by International 
Business Machines Corporation, a New York corporation ("IBM 
Corporation"). The IBM company from which the Licensee acquires 
entitlements ("IBM") is acting as a distributor and delivering Programs 
and is responsible for enforcing the terms of this Agreement. 
If entitlements are acquired from an IBM Business Partner, the 
IBM company for the country of acquisition is responsible for 
enforcing the terms of this Agreement. No right or cause of action is 
created in favor of Licensee against IBM Corporation. Licensee 
waives all claims and causes of action against IBM Corporation and 
agrees to look solely to IBM for any rights and remedies in 
connection with Programs.<br>
<br>
h. Licensee may not sublicense, assign, or transfer the 
license for any Program (except to the extent assignment or 
transfer may not be legally restricted or as is expressly permitted 
in a TD or as otherwise agreed by IBM). IBM may assign its 
rights and obligations under this Agreement in conjunction with 
the sale of the portion of IBM's business that includes a 
Program. IBM may share this Agreement and related documents in 
conjunction with any assignment.<br>
<br>
i. All notices under the Agreement must be in writing and 
sent to the business address specified in the agreement Licensee 
acquired the license entitlements unless a party designates in 
writing a different address. The parties consent to the use of 
electronic means and facsimile transmissions for communications as a 
signed writing. Any reproduction of the Agreement made by reliable 
means is considered an original. Agreement supersedes any course 
of dealing, discussions or representations, between the 
parties.<br>
<br>
j. No right or cause of action for any third party is 
created by the Agreement. Neither party will bring a legal action 
arising out of or related to the Agreement more than two years 
after the cause of action arose. Neither party is responsible for 
failure to fulfill its non-monetary obligations due to causes 
beyond its control. Each party will allow the other reasonable
