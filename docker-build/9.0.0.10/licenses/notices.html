transformation or translation of a Source form, including 
but not <br>
limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, 
and <br>

<br>
"Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source 
or Object <br>
form, made available under the License, as indicated by a 
copyright <br>
notice that is included in or attached to the work (an 
example is <br>
provided in the Appendix below).<br>
<br>
"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source 
or Object <br>
form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for 
which the <br>
editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other 
modifications <br>
represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For 
the <br>
purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not 
include works <br>
that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by 
name) to the <br>
interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br>
<br>
"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including 
the <br>
original version of the Work and any modifications or 
additions to <br>
that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is 
intentionally submitted <br>
to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright 
owner or by an <br>
individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf 
of the <br>
copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition,

systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or 
on behalf <br>
of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and

but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or 
otherwise <br>
designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a 
Contribution."<br>
<br>
"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or 
Legal Entity <br>
on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by 
Licensor and <br>
subsequently incorporated within the Work.<br>
<br>
2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and 
conditions of <br>
this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a 
perpetual, <br>
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, 
irrevocable <br>
copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works 
of, publicly <br>
display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the 
Work and <br>
such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.<br>
<br>
3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and 
conditions of <br>
this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a 
perpetual, <br>
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, 
irrevocable (except <br>
as stated in this section) patent license to make, have 
made, use, <br>
offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the 
Work, where <br>
such license applies only to those patent claims licensable 
by such <br>
Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their 
Contribution(s) <br>
alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the 
Work to <br>
which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute 
patent <br>
litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or 
counterclaim <br>
in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution 
incorporated <br>
within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent <br>
infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under 
this <br>
License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such 
litigation <br>
is filed.<br>
<br>
4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies 
of the Work <br>
or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without <br>
modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that 
You meet <br>
the following conditions:<br>
<br>
 (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or 
Derivative <br>
 Works a copy of this License; and<br>
<br>
 (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent 
notices <br>
 stating that You changed the files; and<br>
<br>
 (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative 
Works <br>
 that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and <br>
 attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, 
excluding <br>
 those notices that do not pertain to any part of the 
Derivative <br>
 Works; and<br>
<br>
 (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of 
its <br>
 distribution, then any Derivative Works that You 
distribute must <br>
 include a readable copy of the attribution notices 
contained <br>
 within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do 
not <br>
 pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least 
one of <br>
 the following places: within a NOTICE text file 
distributed as <br>
 part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or <br>
 documentation, if provided along with the Derivative 
Works; or, <br>
 within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and <br>
 wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The 
contents <br>
 of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and 
do not <br>
 modify the License. You may add Your own attribution 
notices <br>
 within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or 
as an <br>
 addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that 
such <br>
 additional attribution notices cannot be construed as 
modifying <br>
 the License.<br>
<br>
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your 
modifications and may <br>
provide additional or different license terms and 
conditions for use, <br>
reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for 
any such <br>
Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, 
reproduction, and <br>
distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the 
conditions stated <br>
in this License.<br>
<br>
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state 
otherwise, <br>
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in 
the Work by <br>
You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions 
of this <br>
License, without any additional terms or conditions. 
Notwithstanding <br>
the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the 
terms of any <br>
separate license agreement you may have executed with 
Licensor <br>
regarding such Contributions.<br>
<br>
6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to 
use the trade <br>
names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the 
Licensor, <br>
except as required for reasonable and customary use in 
describing the <br>
origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the 
NOTICE file.<br>
<br>
7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable 
law or agreed <br>
to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each 
Contributor <br>
provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT 
WARRANTIES OR <br>
CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, 
including, without <br>
limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-
INFRINGEMENT, <br>
MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You 
are solely <br>
responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or <br>
redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated 
with Your <br>
exercise of permissions under this License.<br>
<br>
8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal 
theory, <br>
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or 
otherwise, unless <br>
required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly 
negligent <br>
acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be 
liable to You <br>
for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, 
incidental, or <br>
consequential damages of any character arising as a result 
of this <br>
License or out of the use or inability to use the Work 
(including but <br>
not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, 
computer <br>
failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial 
damages or <br>
losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the 
possibility <br>
of such damages.<br>
<br>
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While 
redistributing <br>
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to 
offer, and <br>
charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, 
indemnity, or other <br>
liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this 
License. <br>
However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on 
Your own <br>
behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of 
any other <br>
Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, 
and hold each <br>
Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or 
claims asserted <br>
against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any 
such <br>
warranty or additional liability.<br>

          Contributor Version; 2)  separate from the 
Contributor Version;<br>
          3)  for infringements caused by: i) third party 
modifications of<br>
          Contributor Version or ii)  the combination of 
Modifications made<br>
          by that Contributor with other software  (except 
as part of the<br>
          Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) 
under Patent Claims<br>
          infringed by Covered Code in the absence of 
Modifications made by<br>
          that Contributor.<br>
<br>
3. Distribution Obligations.<br>
<br>
     3.1. Application of License.<br>
     The Modifications which You create or to which You 
contribute are<br>
     governed by the terms of this License, including 
without limitation<br>
     Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code 
may be<br>
     distributed only under the terms of this License or a 
future version<br>
     of this License released under Section 6.1, and You 
must include a<br>
     copy of this License with every copy of the Source 
Code You<br>
     distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on 
any Source Code<br>
     version that alters or restricts the applicable 
version of this<br>
     License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, 
You may include<br>
     an additional document offering the additional rights 
described in<br>
     Section 3.5.<br>
<br>
     3.2. Availability of Source Code.<br>
     Any Modification which You create or to which You 
contribute must be<br>
     made available in Source Code form under the terms of 
this License<br>
     either on the same media as an Executable version or 
via an accepted<br>
     Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom 
you made an<br>
     Executable version available; and if made available 
via Electronic<br>
     Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at 
least twelve (12)<br>
     months after the date it initially became available, 
or at least six<br>
     (6) months after a subsequent version of that 
particular Modification<br>
     has been made available to such recipients. You are 
responsible for<br>
     ensuring that the Source Code version remains 
available even if the<br>
     Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a 
third party.<br>
<br>
     3.3. Description of Modifications.<br>
     You must cause all Covered Code to which You 
contribute to contain a<br>
     file documenting the changes You made to create that 
Covered Code and<br>
     the date of any change. You must include a prominent 
statement that<br>
     the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, 
from Original<br>
     Code provided by the Initial Developer and including 
the name of the<br>
     Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in 
any notice in an<br>
     Executable version or related documentation in which 
You describe the<br>
     origin or ownership of the Covered Code.<br>
<br>
     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters<br>
          (a) Third Party Claims.<br>
          If Contributor has knowledge that a license under 
a third party's<br>
          intellectual property rights is required to 
exercise the rights<br>
          granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 
2.2,<br>
          Contributor must include a text file with the 
Source Code<br>
          distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the 
claim and the<br>
          party making the claim in sufficient detail that 
a recipient will<br>
          know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such 
knowledge after<br>
          the Modification is made available as described 
in Section 3.2,<br>
          Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file 
in all copies<br>
          Contributor makes available thereafter and shall 
take other steps<br>
          (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or 
newsgroups)<br>
          reasonably calculated to inform those who 
received the Covered<br>
          Code that new knowledge has been obtained.<br>
<br>
          (b) Contributor APIs.<br>
          If Contributor's Modifications include an 
application programming<br>
          interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent 
licenses which<br>
          are reasonably necessary to implement that API, 
Contributor must<br>
          also include this information in the LEGAL file.<br>
<br>
               (c)    Representations.<br>
          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed 
pursuant to<br>
          Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that 
Contributor's<br>
          Modifications are Contributor's original creation
(s) and/or<br>
          Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the 
rights conveyed by<br>
          this License.<br>
<br>
     3.5. Required Notices.<br>
     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each 
file of the Source<br>
     Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a 
particular Source<br>
     Code file due to its structure, then You must include 
such notice in a<br>
     location (such as a relevant directory) where a user 
would be likely<br>
     to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more 
Modification(s)<br>
     You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice 
described in<br>
     Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in 
any documentation<br>
     for the Source Code where You describe recipients' 
rights or ownership<br>
     rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to 
offer, and to<br>
     charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or 
liability<br>
     obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. 
However, You<br>
     may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf 
of the Initial<br>
     Developer or any Contributor. You must make it 
absolutely clear than<br>
     any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability 
obligation is<br>
     offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to 
indemnify the Initial<br>
     Developer and every Contributor for any liability 
incurred by the<br>
     Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of 
warranty,<br>
     support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.<br>
<br>
     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.<br>
     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form 
only if the<br>
     requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that 
Covered Code,<br>
     and if You include a notice stating that the Source 
Code version of<br>
     the Covered Code is available under the terms of this 
License,<br>
     including a description of how and where You have 
fulfilled the<br>
     obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be 
conspicuously included<br>
     in any notice in an Executable version, related 
documentation or<br>
     collateral in which You describe recipients' rights 
relating to the<br>
     Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable 
version of Covered<br>
     Code or ownership rights under a license of Your 
choice, which may<br>
     contain terms different from this License, provided 
that You are in<br>
     compliance with the terms of this License and that the 
license for the<br>
     Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter 
the recipient's<br>
     rights in the Source Code version from the rights set 
forth in this<br>
     License. If You distribute the Executable version 
under a different<br>
     license You must make it absolutely clear that any 
terms which differ<br>
     from this License are offered by You alone, not by the 
Initial<br>
     Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to 
indemnify the<br>
     Initial Developer and every Contributor for any 
liability incurred by<br>
     the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result 
of any such<br>
     terms You offer.<br>
<br>
     3.7. Larger Works.<br>
     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code 
with other code<br>
     not governed by the terms of this License and 
distribute the Larger<br>
     Work as a single product. In such a case, You must 
make sure the<br>
     requirements of this License are fulfilled for the 
Covered Code.<br>
<br>
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.<br>
<br>
     If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the 
terms of this<br>
     License with respect to some or all of the Covered 
Code due to<br>
     statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: 
(a) comply with<br>
     the terms of this License to the maximum extent 
possible; and (b)<br>
     describe the limitations and the code they affect. 
Such description<br>
     must be included in the LEGAL file described in 
Section 3.4 and must<br>
     be included with all distributions of the Source Code. 
Except to the<br>
     extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such 
description must be<br>
     sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary 
skill to be able to<br>
     understand it.<br>
<br>
5. Application of this License.<br>
<br>
     This License applies to code to which the Initial 
Developer has<br>
     attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related 
Covered Code.<br>
<br>
6. Versions of the License.<br>
<br>
     6.1. New Versions.<br>
     Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may 
publish revised<br>
     and/or new versions of the License from time to time. 
Each version<br>
     will be given a distinguishing version number.<br>
<br>
     6.2. Effect of New Versions.<br>
     Once Covered Code has been published under a 
particular version of the<br>
     License, You may always continue to use it under the 
terms of that<br>
     version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code 
under the terms<br>
     of any subsequent version of the License published by 
Netscape. No one<br>
     other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms 
applicable to<br>
     Covered Code created under this License.<br>
<br>
     6.3. Derivative Works.<br>
     If You create or use a modified version of this 
License (which you may<br>
     only do in order to apply it to code which is not 
already Covered Code<br>
     governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your 
license so that<br>
     the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", 
"Netscape",<br>
     "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not 
appear in your<br>
     license (except to note that your license differs from 
this License)<br>
     and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of 
the license<br>
     contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public 
License and<br>
     Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the 
Initial<br>
     Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice 
described in<br>
     Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be 
modifications of<br>
     this License.)<br>
<br>
7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.<br>
<br>
     COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS 
IS" BASIS,<br>
     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR 
IMPLIED, INCLUDING,<br>
     WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE 
IS FREE OF<br>
     DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR 
NON-INFRINGING.<br>
     THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF 
THE COVERED CODE<br>
     IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE 
IN ANY RESPECT,<br>
     YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER 
CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE<br>
     COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 
THIS DISCLAIMER<br>
     OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS 
LICENSE. NO USE OF<br>
     ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER 
THIS DISCLAIMER.<br>
<br>
8. TERMINATION.<br>
<br>
     8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder 
will terminate<br>
     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein 
and fail to cure<br>
     such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the 
breach. All<br>
     sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly 
granted shall<br>
     survive any termination of this License. Provisions 
which, by their<br>
     nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination 
of this License<br>
     shall survive.<br>
<br>
     8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent 
infringement<br>
     claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against 
Initial Developer<br>
     or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor 
against whom<br>
     You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  
alleging that:<br>
<br>
     (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly 
or indirectly<br>
     infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted 
by such<br>
     Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of 
this License<br>
     shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate 
prospectively,<br>
     unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You 
either: (i)<br>
     agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually 
agreeable reasonable<br>
     royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications 
made by such<br>
     Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim 
with respect to<br>
     the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If 
within 60 days<br>
     of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment 
arrangement are not<br>
     mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the 
litigation claim<br>
     is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to 
You under<br>
     Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the 
expiration of<br>
     the 60 day notice period specified above.<br>
<br>
     (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than 
such Participant's<br>
     Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes 
any patent, then<br>
     any rights granted to You by such Participant under 
Sections 2.1(b)<br>
     and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You 
first made, used,<br>
     sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by 
that<br>
     Participant.<br>
<br>
     8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim 
against Participant<br>
     alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version 
directly or<br>
     indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is 
resolved (such as<br>
     by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of 
patent<br>
     infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of 
the licenses<br>
     granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 
shall be taken<br>
     into account in determining the amount or value of any 
payment or<br>
     license.<br>
<br>
     8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 
or 8.2 above,<br>
     all end user license agreements (excluding 
distributors and resellers)<br>
     which have been validly granted by You or any 
distributor hereunder<br>
     prior to termination shall survive termination.<br>
<br>
9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.<br>
<br>
     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, 
WHETHER TORT<br>
     (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL 
YOU, THE INITIAL<br>
     DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR 
OF COVERED CODE,<br>
     OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO 
ANY PERSON FOR<br>
     ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL 
DAMAGES OF ANY<br>
     CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR 
LOSS OF GOODWILL,<br>
     WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY 
AND ALL OTHER<br>
     COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL 
HAVE BEEN<br>
     INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS 
LIMITATION OF<br>
     LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR 
PERSONAL INJURY<br>
     RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT 
APPLICABLE LAW<br>
     PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT 
ALLOW THE<br>
     EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL 
DAMAGES, SO<br>
     THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br>
<br>
10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.<br>
<br>
     The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term 
is defined in<br>
     48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial 
computer<br>
     software" and "commercial computer software 
documentation," as such<br>
     terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). 
Consistent with 48<br>
     C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 
227.7202-4 (June 1995),<br>
     all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code 
with only those<br>
     rights set forth herein.<br>
<br>
11. MISCELLANEOUS.<br>
<br>
     This License represents the complete agreement 
concerning subject<br>
     matter hereof. If any provision of this License is 
held to be<br>
     unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only 
to the extent<br>
     necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall 
be governed by<br>
     California law provisions (except to the extent 
applicable law, if<br>
     any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-
law provisions.<br>
     With respect to disputes in which at least one party 
is a citizen of,<br>
     or an entity chartered or registered to do business in 
the United<br>
     States of America, any litigation relating to this 
License shall be<br>
     subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of 
the Northern<br>
     District of California, with venue lying in Santa 
Clara County,<br>
     California, with the losing party responsible for 
costs, including<br>
     without limitation, court costs and reasonable 
attorneys' fees and<br>
     expenses. The application of the United Nations 
Convention on<br>
     Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is 
expressly excluded.<br>
     Any law or regulation which provides that the language 
of a contract<br>
     shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply 
to this<br>
     License.<br>
<br>
12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.<br>
<br>
     As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, 
each party is<br>
     responsible for claims and damages arising, directly 
or indirectly,<br>
     out of its utilization of rights under this License 
and You agree to<br>
     work with Initial Developer and Contributors to 
distribute such<br>
     responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein 
is intended or<br>
     shall be deemed to constitute any admission of 
liability.<br>
<br>
13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.<br>
<br>
     Initial Developer may designate portions of the 
Covered Code as<br>
     "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that 
the Initial<br>
     Developer permits you to utilize portions of the 
Covered Code under<br>
     Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if 
any, specified<br>
     by the Initial Developer in the file described in 
Exhibit A.<br>

3. Distribution Obligations.<br>
3.1. Availability of Source Code.<br>
Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make 
available in Executable form must also be made available in Source 
Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only 
under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of this 
License with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered 
Software You distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform 
recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form as to how 
they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a 
reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software 
exchange.<br>
3.2. Modifications.<br>
The Modifications that You create or to which You 
contribute are governed by the terms of this License. You represent 
that You believe Your Modifications are Your original creation
(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to grant the rights 
conveyed by this License.<br>
3.3. Required Notices.<br>
You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications 
that identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You 
may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark 
notices contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of 
licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any 
Contributor or the Initial Developer.<br>
3.4. Application of Additional Terms.<br>
You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered 
Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable 
version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. You 
may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, 
support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more 
recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your 
own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any 
Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, 
support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, 
and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and 
every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial 
Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, 
indemnity or liability terms You offer.<br>
3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.<br>
You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered 
Software under the terms of this License or under the terms of a 
license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this 
License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this 
License and that the license for the Executable form does not 
attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code 
form from the rights set forth in this License. If You 
distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different 
license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which 
differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the 
Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the 
Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred 
by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of 
any such terms You offer.<br>
3.6. Larger Works.<br>
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software 
with other code not governed by the terms of this License and 
distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You 
must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled 
for the Covered Software.<br>
4. Versions of the License.<br>
4.1. New Versions.<br>
Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish 
revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each 
version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as 
provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has 
the right to modify this License.<br>
4.2. Effect of New Versions.<br>
You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise 
make the Covered Software available under the terms of the 
version of the License under which You originally received the 
Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the 
Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise 
made available under any subsequent version of the License, You 
must distribute and make the Covered Software available under 
the terms of the version of the License under which You 
originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also 
choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software 
available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License 
published by the license steward.<br>
4.3. Modified Versions.<br>
When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a 
new license for Your Original Software, You may create and use 
a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the 
license and remove any references to the name of the license 
steward (except to note that the license differs from this 
License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains 
terms which differ from this License.<br>
5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.<br>
COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN “AS 
IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR 
IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED 
SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR 
PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND 
PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED 
SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL 
DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY 
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY 
CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED 
SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.<br>
6. TERMINATION.<br>
6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will 
terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and 
fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the 
breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect 
beyond the termination of this License shall survive.<br>
6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding 
declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a 
Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You 
assert such claim is referred to as “Participant”) alleging that 
the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where 
the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where 
the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or 
indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted 
directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial 
Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all 
Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 
60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and 
automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if 
within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to 
the Participant Software against such Participant either 
unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.<br>
6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against 
Participant alleging that the Participant Software directly or 
indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as 
by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent 
infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses 
granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be 
taken into account in determining the amount or value of any 
payment or license.<br>
6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 
above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You 
or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding 
licenses granted to You by any distributor) shall survive 
termination.<br>
7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.<br>
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER 
TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, 
THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY 
DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH 
PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, 
INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, 
WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, 
COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL 
DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF 
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY 
SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY 
RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW 
PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE 
EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO 
THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br>
8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.<br>
The Covered Software is a “commercial item,” as that term 
is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of 
“commercial computer software” (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. § 
252.227-7014(a)(1)) and “commercial computer software 
documentation” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). 
Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 
227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire 
Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. 
Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, 
DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government 
rights in computer software under this License.<br>
9. MISCELLANEOUS.<br>
This License represents the complete agreement concerning 
subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to 
be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the 
extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be 
governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice 
contained within the Original Software (except to the extent 
applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such 
jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this 
License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located 
in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained 
within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible 
for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and 
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United 
Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods 
is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides 
that the language of a contract shall be construed against the 
drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone 
are responsible for compliance with the United States export 
administration regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of 
any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make 
available any Covered Software.<br>
10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.<br>
As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each 
party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or 
indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You 
agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to 
distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein 
is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of 
liability.<br>
<br>
NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND 
DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL)<br>
The code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the 
laws of the State of California (excluding conflict-of-law 
provisions). Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to 
the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District 
of California and the state courts of the State of California, 
with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California. <br>

GNU Lesser General Public License<br>
Version 2.1, February 1999<br>
Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59 
Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA Everyone is 
permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license 
document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It 
also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, 
version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]<br>
Preamble<br>
The licenses for most software are designed to take away 
your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU 
General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to 
share and change free software--to make sure the software is free 
for all its users.<br>
This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to 
some specially designated software packages--typically 
libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who 
decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first 
think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary 
General Public License is the better strategy to use in any 
particular case, based on the explanations below.<br>
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom 
of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to 
make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free 
software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive 
source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the 
software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are 
informed that you can do these things.<br>
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that 
forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to 
surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain 
responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you 
modify it.<br>
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, 
whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the 
rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, 
receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the 
library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, 
so that they can relink them with the library after making 
changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them 
these terms so they know their rights.<br>
We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we 
copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives 
you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the 
library.<br>
To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear 
that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the 
library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients 
should know that what they have is not the original version, so 
that the original author's reputation will not be affected by 
problems that might be introduced by others.<br>
Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the 
existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company 
cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by 
obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we 
insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the 
library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified 
in this license.<br>
Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by 
the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU 
Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated 
libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public 
License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to 
permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.<br>
When a program is linked with a library, whether statically 
or using a shared library, the combination of the two is 
legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original 
library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such 
linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of 
freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria 
for linking other code with the library.<br>
We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License 
because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the 
ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free 
software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free 
programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary 
General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser 
license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.<br>
For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need 
to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so 
that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free 
programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is 
that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free 
libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free 
library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public 
License.<br>
In other cases, permission to use a particular library in 
non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a 
large body of free software. For example, permission to use the 
GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to 
use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the 
GNU/Linux operating system.<br>
Although the Lesser General Public License is Less 
protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a 
program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the 
wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.<br>
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution 
and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference 
between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the 
library". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas 
the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.<br>
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND 
MODIFICATION<br>
0. This License Agreement applies to any software library 
or other program which contains a notice placed by the 
copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be 
distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also 
called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or 
data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application 
programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form 
executables.<br>
The "Library", below, refers to any such software library 
or work which has been distributed under these terms. A "work 
based on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative 
work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the 
Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications 
and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. 
(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term 
"modification".)<br>
"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the 
work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete 
source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, 
plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts 
used to control compilation and installation of the library.<br>
Activities other than copying, distribution and 
modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its 
scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not 
restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its 
contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the 
use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is 
true depends on what the Library does and what the program that 
uses the Library does.<br>
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the 
Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, 
provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each 
copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; 
keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to 
the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this 
License along with the Library.<br>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a 
copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in 
exchange for a fee.<br>
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any 
portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy 
and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of 
Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these 
conditions:<br>
a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>
b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent 
notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any 
change.<br>
c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at 
no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>
d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a 
function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program 
that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when 
the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort 
to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply 
such function or table, the facility still operates, and 
performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.<br>
(For example, a function in a library to compute square 
roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of 
the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any 
application-supplied function or table used by this function must be 
optional: if the a pplication does not supply it, the square root 
function must still compute square roots.)<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. 
If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the 
Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate 
works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not 
apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate 
works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a 
whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of 
the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose 
permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to 
each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights 
or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; 
rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the 
distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on 
the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the 
Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not 
bring the other work under the scope of this License.<br>
3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU 
General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of 
the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that 
refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU 
General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If 
a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General 
Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version 
instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.<br>
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is 
irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License 
applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from 
that copy.<br>
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the 
code of the Library into a program that is not a library.<br>
4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or 
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form 
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you 
accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source 
code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 
2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>
If distribution of object code is made by offering access 
to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent 
access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the 
requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties 
are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of 
the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being 
compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the 
Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the 
Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br>
However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the 
Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library 
(because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work 
that uses the library". The executable is therefore covered by 
this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such 
executables.<br>
When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a 
header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the 
work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the 
source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant 
if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work 
is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not 
precisely defined by law.<br>
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data 
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline 
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object 
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a 
derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus 
portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br>
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you 
may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of 
Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under 
Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library 
itself.<br>
6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also 
combine or link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to 
produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute 
that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms 
permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and 
reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.<br>
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work 
that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use 
are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this 
License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, 
you must include the copyright notice for the Library among 
them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of 
this License. Also, you must do one of these things:<br>
a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding 
machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever 
changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under 
Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked 
with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that 
uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that 
the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a 
modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is 
understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files 
in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the 
application to use the modified definitions.)<br>
b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with 
the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run 
time a copy of the library already present on the user's 
computer system, rather than copying library functions into the 
executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of 
the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified 
version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was 
made with.<br>
c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at 
least three years, to give the same user the materials specified 
in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of 
performing this distribution.<br>
d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access 
to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to 
copy the above specified materials from the same place.<br>
e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of 
these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br>
For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses 
the Library" must include any data and utility programs needed 
for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special 
exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything 
that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) 
with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the 
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component 
itself accompanies the executable.<br>
It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license 
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally 
accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot 
use both them and the Library together in an executable that 
you distribute.<br>
7. You may place library facilities that are a work based 
on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with 
other library facilities not covered by this License, and 
distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate 
distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library 
facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two 
things:<br>
a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same 
work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library 
facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections 
above.<br>
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the 
fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and 
explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same 
work.<br>
8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or 
distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this 
License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link 
with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically 
terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have 
received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not 
have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in 
full compliance.<br>
9. You are not required to accept this License, since you 
have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission 
to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. 
These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this 
License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any 
work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this 
License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, 
distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.<br>
10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work 
based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a 
license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with 
or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. 
You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' 
exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for 
enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br>
11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation 
of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to 
patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court 
order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of 
this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this 
License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously 
your obligations under this License and any other pertinent 
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at 
all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-
free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive 
copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you 
could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain 
entirely from distribution of the Library.<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or 
unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the 
section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is 
intended to apply in other circumstances.<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to 
infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest 
validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of 
protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system 
which is implemented by public license practices. Many people 
have made generous contributions to the wide range of software 
distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application 
of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he 
or she is willing to distribute software through any other 
system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is 
believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is 
restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted 
interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under 
this License may add an explicit geographical distribution 
limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is 
permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, 
this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the 
body of this License.<br>
13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or 
new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to 
time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present 
version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or 
concerns.<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If 
the Library specifies a version number of this License which 
applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of 
following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any 
later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the 
Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose 
any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into 
other free programs whose distribution conditions are 
incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For 
software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write 
to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions 
for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of 
preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and 
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br>
NO WARRANTY<br>
15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE 
IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY 
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT 
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT 
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT 
NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY 
AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY 
PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, 
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED 
TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY 
WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED 
ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, 
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE 
OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO 
LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES 
SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO 
OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER 
PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries<br>
If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the 
greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free 
software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by 
permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under 
the terms of the ordinary General Public License).<br>
To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the 
library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source 
file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and 
each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a 
pointer to where the full notice is found. <br>
<one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it 
does.> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author><br>
This library is free software; you can redistribute it 
and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public 
License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either 
version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<br>
This library is distributed in the hope that it will be 
useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty 
of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See 
the GNU Lesser General Public License for more details.<br>
You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General 
Public License along with this library; if not, write to the Free 
Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 
02111-1307 USA <br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic 
and paper mail.<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a 
programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" 
for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the 
names:<br>

____________________________________<br>
This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active 
on December 31 2002. This version removes the copyright 
ownership notice such that this license can be used with materials 
other than those owned by the W3C, reflects that ERCIM is now a 
host of the W3C, includes references to this specific dated 
version of the license, and removes the ambiguous grant of "use". 
Otherwise, this version is the same as the previous version and is 
written so as to preserve the Free Software Foundation's assessment 
of GPL compatibility and OSI's certification under the Open 
Source Definition. Please see our Copyright FAQ for common 
questions about using materials from our site, including specific 
terms and conditions for packages like libwww, Amaya, and Jigsaw.
