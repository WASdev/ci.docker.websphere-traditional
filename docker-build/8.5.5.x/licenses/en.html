LICENSE INFORMATION<br>
<br>
The Programs listed below are licensed under the following 
License Information terms and conditions in addition to the Program 
license terms previously agreed to by Client and IBM. If Client 
does not have previously agreed to license terms in effect for 
the Program, the International License Agreement for Non-
Warranted Programs (i125-5589-06) applies.<br>
<br>
Program Name (Program Number):<br>
IBM WebSphere Application Server for Developers V8.5.5.22 
(Component)<br>
<br>
The following standard terms apply to Licensee's use of the 
Program.<br>
<br>
Developer Limitation<br>
<br>
If the Program is designated as for "Developers", Licensee 
can only use the Program as part of Licensee's internal 
development and unit testing on a developer machine. A developer 
machine is a physical or virtual desktop environment, running a 
primary operating system and the Program, both of which are 
accessible and used by no more than one specified developer.<br>
<br>
Modifiable Third Party Code<br>
<br>
To the extent, if any, in the NOTICES file IBM identifies 
third party code as "Modifiable Third Party Code," IBM authorizes 
Licensee to 1) modify the Modifiable Third Party Code and 2) reverse 
engineer the Program modules that directly interface with the 
Modifiable Third Party Code provided that it is only for the purpose 
of debugging Licensee's modifications to such third party 
code. IBM's service and support obligations, if any, apply only 
to the unmodified Program.<br>
<br>
Separately Licensed Code<br>
<br>
Each of the components listed in the NON_IBM_LICENSE file 
is considered "Separately Licensed Code" licensed to Licensee 
under the terms of the applicable third party license agreement
(s) set forth in the NON_IBM_LICENSE file(s) that accompanies 
the Program, and not this Agreement. Future Program updates or 
fixes may contain additional Separately Licensed Code. Such 
additional Separately Licensed Code and related licenses are listed in 
the applicable NON_IBM_LICENSE file that accompanies the 
Program update or fix. <br>
<br>
Note: Notwithstanding any of the terms in the third party 
license agreement, the Agreement, or any other agreement Licensee 
may have with IBM, with respect to the Separately Licensed 
Code: <br>
(a) IBM provides it to Licensee WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY 
KIND AND DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL EXPRESS AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES 
AND CONDITIONS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE WARRANTY OF 
TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR NON-INTERFERENCE, AND THE IMPLIED 
WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE;<br>
(b) IBM is not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, 
special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages including, but 
not limited to, lost data, lost savings, and lost profits.<br>
<br>
Source Components and Sample Materials<br>
<br>
The Program includes components in source code form 
("Source Components"), or other materials identified as Sample 
Materials or both. Licensee may copy and modify Source Components and 
Sample Materials for internal use only within the limits of the 
license rights under this Agreement; provided, however, that 
Licensee may not alter or delete any copyright information or 
notices contained in the Source Components or Sample Materials. IBM 
provides the Source Components and Sample Materials without 
obligation of support and "AS IS", WITH NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, 
EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE WARRANTY OF TITLE, NON-
INFRINGEMENT OR NON-INTERFERENCE AND THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND 
CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.<br>

<br>
Part 1 - General Terms<br>
<br>
BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, COPYING, ACCESSING, CLICKING ON 
AN "ACCEPT" BUTTON, OR OTHERWISE USING THE PROGRAM, LICENSEE 
AGREES TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE ACCEPTING THESE 
TERMS ON BEHALF OF LICENSEE, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE FULL 
AUTHORITY TO BIND LICENSEE TO THESE TERMS.<br>
<br>
IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS OR DO NOT HAVE 
AUTHORITY: i) DO NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, COPY, ACCESS, CLICK ON AN 
"ACCEPT" BUTTON, OR USE THE PROGRAM; AND ii) PROMPTLY RETURN THE 
UNUSED MEDIA AND DOCUMENTATION, AND PROOF OF ENTITLEMENT TO THE

<br>
This International License Agreement for Non-Warranted 
Programs (ILAN) and applicable Transaction Documents (together the 
"Agreement") are the complete agreement between Licensee and IBM 
regarding the use of a Program. The country required terms included 
in Part 2 of this ILAN replace or modify the terms of Part 1.<br>
<br>
Transaction Documents (TDs) provide a description, 
information, and terms regarding the Program and its authorized use. 
Examples of TDs for Programs include license information (LI), 
licensed program specifications (LPS), quote, proof of entitlement 
(PoE) or invoice. To the extent of any conflict a TD will prevail 
over the ILAN.<br>
<br>
1. Program License<br>
<br>
a. A Program is an executable IBM-branded computer program 
and its related material and includes whole and partial copies. 
Program details are described in a TD available at http://www.ibm.
com/software/sla (for Passport Advantage Programs) or http://www.ibm.
com/support/knowledgecenter (for other IBM Programs), in the Program's system command 
directory, or as otherwise specified by IBM. IBM software policies 
(such as backup, temporary use and IBM approved cloud 
environment) available at http://www.ibm.com/softwarepolicies apply to 
Licensee's use of Programs.<br>
<br>
b. Copies of Programs are copyrighted and licensed.<br>
<br>
c. Licensee is granted a nonexclusive license to:<br>
<br>
(1) use each copy of a Program, subject to the terms of the 
Agreement and, if applicable, up to the number of license 
entitlements Licensee acquires ("Authorized Use");<br>
<br>
(2) make and install copies to support such Authorized Use; 
and<br>
<br>
(3) make a backup copy.<br>
<br>
d. Programs may be used by Licensee, its employees and 
contractors. Licensee may not rent or lease a Program or provide 
commercial IT, hosting or timesharing services to any third party. 
Additional rights may be available for additional fees or under 
different terms.<br>
<br>
e. The license granted for a Program is subject to Licensee:<br>
<br>
(1) reproducing copyright notices and other markings on any 
copy;<br>
<br>
(2) ensuring anyone who uses the Program: i) does so only 
on Licensee's behalf within Licensee's Authorized Use; and ii) 
complies with this Agreement;<br>
<br>
(3) not reverse assembling, reverse compiling, translating, 
or reverse engineering the Program, except as expressly 
permitted by law without the possibility of contractual waiver; and<br>
<br>
(4) not using any of the elements of the Program or related 
licensed materials separately from the Program.<br>
<br>
f. If the TD for a Program ("Principal Program") states 
that a "Supporting Program" is included with the Principal 
Program, Licensee may use the Supporting Program subject to any 
license limitations of the Principal Program and only to support 
the Principal Program.<br>
<br>
g. This license applies to each copy of the Program that 
Licensee makes.<br>
<br>
h. An update, fix, or patch to a Program is subject to the 
terms governing the Program unless new terms are provided in an 
updated TD. Licensee accepts such new terms upon installation of 
the update, fix, or patch. If a Program is replaced by an 
update, Licensee agrees to promptly discontinue use of the replaced 
Program.<br>
<br>
i. If Licensee is dissatisfied with a Program for any 
reason, Licensee may terminate the license by returning the Program 
and proof of entitlement to IBM or the authorized IBM Business 
Partner within 30 days of the original acquisition date of such 
Program for a refund of the amount paid. For a downloaded Program, 
contact the party Licensee acquired the Program from for refund 
instructions.<br>
<br>
2. Warranties<br>
<br>
a. IBM does not warrant uninterrupted or error-free 
operation of an IBM Program or that IBM will correct all defects or 
prevent third party disruptions. These warranties are the exclusive 
warranties from IBM and replace all other warranties, including the 
implied warranties or conditions of satisfactory quality, 
merchantability, non-infringement, and fitness for a particular purpose. IBM 
warranties will not apply if there has been misuse, modification, 
damage not caused by IBM, or failure to comply with written 
instructions provided by IBM. Non-IBM Programs are provided as-is, 
without warranties of any kind. Third parties may provide their own 
warranties to Licensee.<br>
<br>
b. Additional support available during or after the 
warranty period may be available under separate agreement.<br>
<br>
3. Charges, Taxes, Payment, and Verification<br>
<br>
a. Licensee's right to use a Program is contingent on 
Licensee paying applicable charges, if any, as specified in the 
agreement under which Licensee acquired the license entitlements. 
Licensee is responsible to acquire additional license entitlements 
in advance of any increase of its use.<br>
<br>
b. Licensee agrees to pay all applicable charges for 
acquired entitlements and any charges for use in excess of 
authorizations. Charges are exclusive of any customs or other duty, tax, 
and similar levies imposed by any authority resulting from 
Licensee's acquisition of entitlements and will be invoiced in 
addition to such charges. Amounts are due upon receipt of the 
invoice from IBM and payable within 30 days of the invoice date to 
an account specified by IBM and late payment fees may apply. 
Licensee is responsible to properly acquire additional license 
entitlements in advance to increase its use. IBM does not give credits 
or refunds for charges already due or paid, except as 
specified elsewhere in this ILAN, the applicable TD, or terms of the 
agreement under which Licensee acquired license entitlements.<br>
<br>
c. Based on acquired entitlements, Licensee agrees to: i) 
pay any withholding tax directly to the appropriate government 
entity where required by law; ii) furnish a tax certificate 
evidencing such payment to IBM; iii) pay IBM only the net proceeds 
after tax; and iv) fully cooperate with IBM in seeking a waiver 
or reduction of such taxes and promptly complete and file all 
relevant documents.<br>
<br>
d. If Licensee imports, exports, transfers, accesses, or 
uses a Program across a border, Licensee agrees to be 
responsible for and pay authorities any custom, duty, tax, or similar 
levy assessed by the authorities. This excludes those taxes 
based on IBM's net income.<br>
<br>
3.1 Licensing Verification<br>
<br>
a. Licensee will, for all Programs at all sites and for all 
environments, create, retain, and each year provide to IBM upon request 
with 30 days' advance notice: i) a report, in a format requested 
by IBM using records, system tools output, and other system 
information; and ii) supporting documentation (collectively, "Deployment 
Data").<br>
<br>
b. Upon reasonable notice, IBM and its independent auditors 
may verify Licensee's compliance with this Agreement, at all 
sites and for all environments, in which Licensee uses (for any 
purposes) Programs. Verification will be conducted in a manner that 
minimizes disruption to Licensee's business and may be conducted on 
Licensee's premises, during normal business hours. IBM will have a 
written confidentiality agreement with the independent auditor. In 
addition to providing Deployment Data described above, Licensee 
agrees to provide to IBM and its auditors additional accurate 
information and Deployment Data upon request.<br>
<br>
c. Licensee will promptly order and pay charges at IBM's 
then current rates associated with: i) any deployments in excess 
of authorizations indicated on or by any annual report or 
verification; ii) applicable subscription & support services (S&S) for 
such excess deployments for the lesser of the duration of such 
excess use or two years; and iii) any additional charges and other 
liabilities determined as a result of such verification, including but 
not limited to taxes, duties, and regulatory fees.<br>
<br>
4. Liability and Intellectual Property Protection<br>
<br>
a. IBM's entire liability for all claims related to this 
Agreement will not exceed the amount of any actual direct damages 
incurred by Licensee up to the greater of: i) U.S. $10,000.00 (or 
equivalent in local currency); or ii) the amounts paid (if recurring 
charges, up to 12 months' charges apply) for the entitlements to the 
Program that is the subject of the claim, regardless of the basis 
of the claim. IBM will not be liable for special, incidental, 
exemplary, indirect, or economic consequential damages, or for lost 
profits, business, value, revenue, goodwill, or anticipated savings. 
These limitations apply collectively to IBM, its affiliates, 
contractors, and suppliers.<br>
<br>
b. The following amounts are not subject to the above cap: 
damages that cannot be limited under applicable law.<br>
<br>
c. IBM has no responsibility for claims based on non-IBM 
products, items not provided by IBM, or any violation of law or third 
party rights caused by Content, or any Licensee materials, 
designs, specifications. Content consists of all data, software, and 
information that Licensee or its authorized users provide, authorize 
access to, or inputs to a Program.<br>
<br>
5. Termination<br>
<br>
a. IBM may terminate Licensee's license to use a Program if 
Licensee fails to comply with the ILAN, TDs or acquisition 
agreements, such as the International Passport Advantage Agreement 
(IPAA). Licensee will promptly destroy all copies of the Program 
after license termination. Any terms that by their nature extend 
beyond the termination remain in effect until fulfilled and apply 
to successors and assignees.<br>
<br>
6. Governing Laws and Geographic Scope<br>
<br>
a. Both parties agree to the application of the laws of the 
country where the transaction for license entitlements is 
performed, without regard to conflict of law principles. The rights 
and obligations of each party are valid only in the country 
where the transaction to acquire license entitlements is 
performed or, if IBM agrees, the country where the Program is placed 
in productive use, except all licenses are valid as 
specifically granted.<br>
<br>
b. Each party is also responsible for complying with: i) 
laws and regulations applicable to its business and Content; and 
ii) import, export and economic sanction laws and regulations, 
including the defense trade control regime of the United States of 
America and any applicable jurisdictions, that prohibit or restrict 
the import, export, re-export, or transfer of products, 
technology, services or data, directly or indirectly, to or for certain 
countries, end uses or end users.<br>
<br>
c. If any provision of this Agreement for a Program, is 
invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in full 
force and effect. Nothing in this Agreement affects statutory 
rights of consumers that cannot be waived or limited by contract. 
The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the 
International Sale of Goods does not apply to transactions under this 
Agreement.<br>
<br>
7. General<br>
<br>
a. IBM is an independent contractor, not Licensee's agent, 
joint venturer, partner, or fiduciary, and does not undertake to 
perform any of Licensee's regulatory obligations, or assume any 
responsibility for Licensee's business or operations. Licensee is 
responsible for its use of IBM Programs and Non-IBM Programs. IBM is 
acting as an information technology provider only. IBM's 
direction, suggested usage, or guidance or use of a Program does not 
constitute medical, clinical, legal, accounting, or other licensed 
professional advice. Licensee should obtain its own expert advice.<br>
<br>
b. For Programs IBM provides to Licensee in tangible form, 
IBM fulfills its shipping and delivery obligations upon the 
delivery of such Programs to the IBM-designated carrier, unless 
otherwise agreed to in writing by Licensee and IBM.<br>
<br>
c. Licensee may not use the Program if failure of the 
Program could lead to death, serious bodily injury, or property or 
environmental damage.<br>
<br>
d. IBM, its affiliates, and contractors of either require 
use of business contact information and certain account usage 
information. This information is not Content. Business contact 
information is used to communicate and manage business dealings with 
the Licensee. Examples of business contact information include 
name, business telephone, address, email, user ID, and tax 
registration information. Account usage information is required to 
enable, provide, manage, support, administer, and improve Programs. 
Examples of account usage information include reported errors and 
digital information gathered using tracking technologies, such as 
cookies and web beacons, during use of the Programs. The IBM 
Privacy Statement at http://www.ibm.com/privacy provides additional 
details with respect to IBM's collection, use, and handling of 
business contact and account usage information. When Licensee 
provides information to IBM and notice to, or consent by, the 
individuals is required for such processing, Licensee will notify 
individuals and obtain consent.<br>
<br>
e. IBM Business Partners who use or make available Programs 
are independent from IBM and unilaterally determine their 
prices and terms. IBM is not responsible for their actions, 
omissions, statements, or offerings.<br>
<br>
f. IBM may offer Non-IBM Programs, or an IBM Program may 
enable access to Non-IBM Programs, that may require acceptance of 
third party terms identified in a TD or presented to the 
Licensee. Linking to or use of Non-IBM Programs constitutes 
Licensee's agreement with such terms. IBM is not a party to such third 
party agreements and is not responsible for such Non-IBM Programs.<br>
<br>
g. License grants to Programs are provided by International 
Business Machines Corporation, a New York corporation ("IBM 
Corporation"). The IBM company from which the Licensee acquires 
entitlements ("IBM") is acting as a distributor and delivering Programs 
and is responsible for enforcing the terms of this Agreement. 
If entitlements are acquired from an IBM Business Partner, the 
IBM company for the country of acquisition is responsible for 
enforcing the terms of this Agreement. No right or cause of action is 
created in favor of Licensee against IBM Corporation. Licensee 
waives all claims and causes of action against IBM Corporation and 
agrees to look solely to IBM for any rights and remedies in 
connection with Programs.<br>
<br>
h. Licensee may not sublicense, assign, or transfer the 
license for any Program (except to the extent assignment or 
transfer may not be legally restricted or as is expressly permitted 
in a TD or as otherwise agreed by IBM). IBM may assign its 
rights and obligations under this Agreement in conjunction with 
the sale of the portion of IBM's business that includes a 
Program. IBM may share this Agreement and related documents in 
conjunction with any assignment.<br>
<br>
i. All notices under the Agreement must be in writing and 
sent to the business address specified in the agreement Licensee 
acquired the license entitlements unless a party designates in 
writing a different address. The parties consent to the use of 
electronic means and facsimile transmissions for communications as a 
signed writing. Any reproduction of the Agreement made by reliable 
means is considered an original. Agreement supersedes any course 
of dealing, discussions or representations, between the 
parties.<br>
<br>
j. No right or cause of action for any third party is 
created by the Agreement. Neither party will bring a legal action 
arising out of or related to this Agreement more than two years 
after the cause of action arose. Neither party is responsible for 
failure to fulfill its non-monetary obligations due to causes 
beyond its control. Each party will allow the other reasonable 
opportunity to comply before it claims the other has not met its 
obligations.<br>
<br>
k. IBM may use personnel and resources in locations 
worldwide, including third party contractors to support the delivery 
of Programs and Program support. Licensee's use of Programs 
may result in the transfer of Content, including personally 
identifiable information, across country borders to provide Program 
support as described in the IBM Software Support Guide.<br>
<br>
