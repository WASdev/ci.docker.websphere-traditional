GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
Version 2, June 1991<br>
<br>
Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA<br>
<br>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim 
copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
Preamble<br>
<br>
The licenses for most software are designed to take away 
your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU 
General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to 
share and change free software--to make sure the software is free 
for all its users. This General Public License applies to most 
of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other 
program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software 
Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public 
License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.<br>
<br>
When we speak of free software, we are referring to 
freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make 
sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free 
software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive 
source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the 
software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know 
you can do these things.<br>
<br>
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that 
forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender 
the rights. These restrictions translate to certain 
responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you 
modify it.<br>
<br>
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, 
whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the 
rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive 
or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms 
so they know their rights.<br>
<br>
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the 
software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal 
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.<br>
<br>
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to 
make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty 
for this free software. If the software is modified by someone 
else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what 
they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced 
by others will not reflect on the original authors' 
reputations.<br>
<br>
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by 
software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of 
a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in 
effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have 
made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's 
free use or not licensed at all.<br>
<br>
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution 
and modification follow.<br>
<br>
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND 
MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
    0. This License applies to any program or other work 
which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it 
may be distributed under the terms of this General Public 
License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, 
and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or 
any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work 
containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with 
modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, 
translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) 
Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
    Activities other than copying, distribution and 
modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its 
scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the 
output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute 
a work based on the Program (independent of having been made 
by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what 
the Program does.<br>
    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the 
Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that 
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an 
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact 
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence 
of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program 
a copy of this License along with the Program.<br>
<br>
    You may charge a fee for the physical act of 
transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty 
protection in exchange for a fee.<br>
    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or 
any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, 
and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the 
terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of 
these conditions:<br>
        a) You must cause the modified files to carry 
prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of 
any change.<br>
        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or 
publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the 
Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge 
to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>
        c) If the modified program normally reads commands 
interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such 
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an 
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that 
there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a 
warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these 
conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. 
(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally 
print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not 
required to print an announcement.)<br>
<br>
    These requirements apply to the modified work as a 
whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from 
the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and 
separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do 
not apply to those sections when you distribute them as 
separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of 
a whole which is a work based on the Program, the 
distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose 
permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to 
each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br>
<br>
    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim 
rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; 
rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the 
distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.<br>
<br>
    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based 
on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the 
Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not 
bring the other work under the scope of this License.<br>
    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work 
based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form 
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also 
do one of the following:<br>
        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding 
machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the 
terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for 
software interchange; or,<br>
        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at 
least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more 
than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a 
complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to 
be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a 
medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>
        c) Accompany it with the information you received 
as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This 
alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if 
you received the program in object code or executable form with 
such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<br>
<br>
    The source code for a work means the preferred form of 
the work for making modifications to it. For an executable 
work, complete source code means all the source code for all 
modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition 
files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and 
installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the 
source code distributed need not include anything that is normally 
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components 
(compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the 
executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the 
executable.<br>
<br>
    If distribution of executable or object code is made by 
offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering 
equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts 
as distribution of the source code, even though third parties 
are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute 
the Program except as expressly provided under this License. 
Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute 
the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your 
rights under this License. However, parties who have received 
copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their 
licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full 
compliance.<br>
    5. You are not required to accept this License, since 
you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you 
permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative 
works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept 
this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the 
Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your 
acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions 
for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works 
based on it.<br>
    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work 
based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a 
license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify 
the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not 
impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the 
rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing 
compliance by third parties to this License.<br>
    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or 
allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited 
to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by 
court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the 
conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions 
of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy 
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent 
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at 
all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-
free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive 
copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you 
could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain 
entirely from distribution of the Program.<br>
<br>
    If any portion of this section is held invalid or 
unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the 
section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended 
to apply in other circumstances.<br>
<br>
    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to 
infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest 
validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of 
protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, 
which is implemented by public license practices. Many people 
have made generous contributions to the wide range of software 
distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application 
of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he 
or she is willing to distribute software through any other 
system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.<br>
<br>
    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what 
is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is 
restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted 
interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under 
this License may add an explicit geographical distribution 
limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is 
permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, 
this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the 
body of this License.<br>
    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised 
and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to 
time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present 
version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or 
concerns.<br>
<br>
    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. 
If the Program specifies a version number of this License 
which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option 
of following the terms and conditions either of that version 
or of any later version published by the Free Software 
Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this 
License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free 
Software Foundation.<br>
    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program 
into other free programs whose distribution conditions are 
different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software 
which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to 
the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for 
this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving 
the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of 
promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
    NO WARRANTY<br>
    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, 
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY 
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT 
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT 
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT 
NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY 
AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM 
PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, 
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR 
AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY 
WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED 
ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, 
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE 
OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO 
LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES 
SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO 
OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER 
PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
