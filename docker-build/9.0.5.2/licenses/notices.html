   "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in 
Source or<br>
   Object form, made available under the License, as 
indicated by a<br>
   copyright notice that is included in or attached to the 
work<br>
   (an example is provided in the Appendix below).<br>
<br>
   "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in 
Source or Object<br>
   form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and 
for which the<br>
   editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other 
modifications<br>
   represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. 
For the purposes<br>
   of this License, Derivative Works shall not include 
works that remain<br>
   separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the 
interfaces of,<br>
   the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br>
<br>
   "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, 
including<br>
   the original version of the Work and any modifications 
or additions<br>
   to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is

copyright owner<br>
   or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit 
on behalf of<br>
   the copyright owner. For the purposes of this 
definition, "submitted"<br>
   means any form of electronic, verbal, or written 
communication sent<br>
   to the Licensor or its representatives, including but 
not limited to<br>
   communication on electronic mailing lists, source code 
control systems,<br>
   and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on

Contribution."<br>
<br>
   "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or

   on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by 
Licensor and<br>
   subsequently incorporated within the Work.<br>
<br>
2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and 
conditions of<br>
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a 
perpetual,<br>
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, 
irrevocable<br>
   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works 
of,<br>
   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and 
distribute the<br>
   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.<br>
<br>

irrevocable<br>
   (except as stated in this section) patent license to 
make, have made,<br>
   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer 
the Work,<br>
   where such license applies only to those patent claims 
licensable<br>
   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by 
their<br>
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their 
Contribution(s)<br>
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was 
submitted. If You<br>
   institute patent litigation against any entity 
(including a<br>
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that 
the Work<br>
   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work 
constitutes direct<br>
   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent 
licenses<br>
   granted to You under this License for that Work shall 
terminate<br>
   as of the date such litigation is filed.<br>
<br>
4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies 
of the<br>
   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or 
without<br>
   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided 
that You<br>
   meet the following conditions:<br>
<br>
   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br>
       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br>
<br>
   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent 
notices<br>
       stating that You changed the files; and<br>
<br>
   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any 
Derivative Works<br>
       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, 
trademark, and<br>
       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br>
       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any 
part of<br>
       the Derivative Works; and<br>
<br>
   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of 
its<br>
       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You 
distribute must<br>
       include a readable copy of the attribution notices 
contained<br>
       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices 
that do not<br>
       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at 
least one<br>
       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file 
distributed<br>
       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source 
form or<br>
       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative 
Works; or,<br>
       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, 
if and<br>
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. 
The contents<br>
       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes 
only and<br>
       do not modify the License. You may add Your own 
attribution<br>
       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, 
alongside<br>
       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, 
provided<br>
       that such additional attribution notices cannot be 
construed<br>
       as modifying the License.<br>
<br>
   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your 
modifications and<br>
   may provide additional or different license terms and 
conditions<br>
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your 
modifications, or<br>
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your 
use,<br>
   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise 
complies with<br>
   the conditions stated in this License.<br>
<br>
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state 
otherwise,<br>
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion 
in the Work<br>
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and 
conditions of<br>
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br>
   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall 
supersede or modify<br>
   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have 
executed<br>
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br>
<br>
6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to 
use the trade<br>
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of 
the Licensor,<br>
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in 
describing the<br>
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the 
NOTICE file.<br>
<br>
7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable 
law or<br>
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and 
each<br>
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" 
BASIS,<br>
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either 
express or<br>
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties 
or conditions<br>
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS 
FOR A<br>
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for 
determining the<br>
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and 
assume any<br>
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under 
this License.<br>
<br>
8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal 
theory,<br>
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or 
otherwise,<br>
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate 
and grossly<br>
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any 
Contributor be<br>
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, 
indirect, special,<br>
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character 
arising as a<br>
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to 
use the<br>
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of 
goodwill,<br>
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any 
and all<br>
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such 
Contributor<br>
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br>
<br>
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While 
redistributing<br>
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to 
offer,<br>
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, 
indemnity,<br>
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent 
with this<br>
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may 
act only<br>
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not 
on behalf<br>
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to 
indemnify,<br>
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any 
liability<br>
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such 
Contributor by reason<br>
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional 
liability.<br>

representatives, including but not limited to communication 
on <br>
electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and 
issue <br>
tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the 
Licensor for <br>
the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but 
excluding <br>
communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise 
designated in <br>
writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution." <br>
<br>
"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or 
Legal Entity on <br>
behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor 
and <br>
subsequently incorporated within the Work. <br>
<br>
2. Grant of Copyright License. <br>
<br>
Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each 
Contributor <br>
hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, 
no-charge, <br>
royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, 
prepare <br>
Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, 
sublicense, and <br>
distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or 
Object form. <br>
<br>
3. Grant of Patent License. <br>
<br>
Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each 
Contributor <br>
hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, 
no-charge, <br>
royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this 
section) patent <br>
license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, 
import, and <br>
otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies 
only to those <br>
patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are 
necessarily <br>
infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination 
of their <br>
Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) 
was <br>
submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any 
entity <br>
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) 
alleging that the <br>
Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work 
constitutes direct <br>
or contributory patent infringement, then any patent 
licenses granted to <br>
You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of 
the date such <br>
litigation is filed. Any patent license granted hereby with 
respect to <br>
contributions by an individual employed by an institution 
or <br>
organization is limited to patent claims where the 
individual that is <br>
the author of the Work is also the inventor of the patent 
claims <br>
licensed, and where the organization or institution has the 
right to <br>
grant such license under applicable grant and research 
funding <br>
agreements. No other express or implied licenses are 
granted. <br>
<br>
4. Redistribution. <br>
<br>
You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or 
Derivative Works <br>
thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and 
in Source or <br>
Object form, provided that You meet the following 
conditions: <br>
<br>
1. You must give any other recipients of the Work or 
Derivative Works a <br>
   copy of this License; and <br>
<br>
2. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent 
notices stating <br>
   that You changed the files; and <br>
<br>
3. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative 
Works that You <br>
   distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and 
attribution notices <br>
   from the Source form of the Work, excluding those 
notices that do not <br>
   pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and <br>
<br>
4. If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its <br>
   distribution, then any Derivative Works that You 
distribute must include <br>
   a readable copy of the attribution notices contained 
within such NOTICE <br>
   file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any 
part of the <br>
   Derivative Works, in at least one of the following 
places: within a <br>
   NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative 
Works; within the <br>
   Source form or documentation, if provided along with the 
Derivative <br>
   Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative 
Works, if and <br>
   wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The 
contents of the <br>
   NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do 
not modify the <br>
   License. You may add Your own attribution notices within 
Derivative <br>
   Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum 
to the NOTICE <br>
   text from the Work, provided that such additional 
attribution notices <br>
   cannot be construed as modifying the License. <br>
<br>
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your 
modifications and may <br>
provide additional or different license terms and 
conditions for use, <br>
reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for 
any such <br>
Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, 
reproduction, and <br>
distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the 
conditions stated <br>
in this License. <br>
<br>
5. Submission of Contributions. <br>
<br>
Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution 
intentionally <br>
submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor 
shall be <br>
under the terms and conditions of this License, without any 
additional <br>
terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing 
herein shall <br>
supersede or modify the terms of any separate license 
agreement you may <br>
have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions. <br>
<br>
6. Trademarks. <br>
<br>
This License does not grant permission to use the trade 
names, <br>
trademarks, service marks, or product names of the 
Licensor, except as <br>
required for reasonable and customary use in describing the 
origin of <br>
the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file. <br>
<br>
7. Disclaimer of Warranty. <br>
<br>
Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, 
Licensor <br>
provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its 
Contributions) on <br>
an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY 
KIND, either <br>
express or implied, including, without limitation, any 
warranties or <br>
conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or 
FITNESS FOR A <br>
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for 
determining the <br>
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and 
assume any risks <br>
associated with Your exercise of permissions under this 
License. <br>
<br>
8. Limitation of Liability. <br>
<br>
In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort 
(including <br>
negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by 
applicable law <br>
(such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed 
to in writing, <br>
shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, 
including any <br>
direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential 
damages of any <br>
character arising as a result of this License or out of the 
use or <br>
inability to use the Work (including but not limited to 
damages for loss <br>
of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or 
malfunction, or any and <br>
all other commercial damages or losses), even if such 
Contributor has <br>
been advised of the possibility of such damages. <br>
<br>
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. <br>
<br>
While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, 
You may <br>
choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of 
support, warranty, <br>
indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights 
consistent with <br>
this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You 
may act only <br>
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on 
behalf of any <br>
other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, 
defend, and hold <br>
each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or 
claims <br>
asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your 
accepting any such <br>
warranty or additional liability. <br>

parties, PROVIDED<br>
 #  that the provisions of Section 3 ("NO WARRANTY") will 
ALWAYS appear<br>

basis.  <br>

4. Time Zone Database<br>
<br>
  ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from 
Time Zone <br>
  Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the 
TZ database <br>
  is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the 
Time Zone <br>
  Database section 7.<br>
<br>
  7.  Database Ownership<br>
<br>
    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or 
an IETF<br>
    document. Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly 
updated work<br>
    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain 
in the <br>
    public domain. Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 
[RFC3979] do not <br>
    apply to the TZ Database or contributions that 
individuals make to <br>
    it. Should any claims be made and substantiated against 
the TZ <br>
    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA 
Considerations <br>
    defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of 
understanding with the <br>
    IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance with all 
competent <br>
    court orders. No ownership claims will be made by ICANN 
or the IETF <br>
    Trust on the database or the code.  Any person making a 
contribution<br>
    to the database or code waives all rights to future 
claims in that<br>
    contribution or in the TZ Database.<br>

<br>
Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It 
also counts<br>
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, 
version 2, hence<br>
 the version number 2.1.]<br>
<br>
Preamble<br>
<br>
The licenses for most software are designed to take away 
your freedom to <br>
share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public 
Licenses are <br>
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free 
software--to <br>
make sure the software is free for all its users. <br>
<br>
This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to 
some <br>
specially designated software packages--typically 
libraries--of the Free <br>
Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. 
You can use <br>
it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about 
whether this <br>
license or the ordinary General Public License is the 
better strategy to <br>
use in any particular case, based on the explanations 
below. <br>
<br>
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom 
of use, not <br>
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make 
sure that you <br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and 
charge for <br>
this service if you wish); that you receive source code or 
can get it if <br>
you want it; that you can change the software and use 
pieces of it in <br>
new free programs; and that you are informed that you can 
do these <br>
things. <br>
<br>
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that 
forbid <br>
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to 
surrender these <br>
rights. These restrictions translate to certain 
responsibilities for you <br>
if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify 
it. <br>
<br>
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, 
whether gratis or <br>
for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that 
we gave you. <br>
You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the 
source code. <br>
If you link other code with the library, you must provide 
complete <br>
object files to the recipients, so that they can relink 
them with the <br>
library after making changes to the library and recompiling 
it. And you <br>
must show them these terms so they know their rights. <br>
<br>
We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we 
copyright the <br>
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you 
legal <br>
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. <br>
<br>
To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear 
that there is <br>
no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is 
modified by <br>
someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that 
what they <br>
have is not the original version, so that the original 
author's <br>
reputation will not be affected by problems that might be 
introduced by <br>
others. <br>
<br>
Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the 
existence of any <br>
free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot 
effectively <br>
restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a 
restrictive license <br>
from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent 
license <br>
obtained for a version of the library must be consistent 
with the full <br>
freedom of use specified in this license. <br>
<br>
Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by 
the ordinary <br>
GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser 
General Public <br>
License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is 
quite different <br>
from the ordinary General Public License. We use this 
license for <br>
certain libraries in order to permit linking those 
libraries into <br>
non-free programs. <br>
<br>
When a program is linked with a library, whether statically 
or using a <br>
shared library, the combination of the two is legally 
speaking a <br>
combined work, a derivative of the original library. The 
ordinary <br>
General Public License therefore permits such linking only 
if the entire <br>
combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser 
General Public <br>
License permits more lax criteria for linking other code 
with the <br>
library. <br>
<br>
We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License 
because it does <br>
Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary 
General Public <br>
License. It also provides other free software developers 
Less of an <br>
advantage over competing non-free programs. These 
disadvantages are the <br>
reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many 
libraries. <br>
However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain 
special <br>
circumstances. <br>
<br>
For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need 
to <br>
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so 
that it <br>
becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free 
programs must be <br>
allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a 
free library <br>
does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In 
this case, there <br>
is little to gain by limiting the free library to free 
software only, so <br>
we use the Lesser General Public License. <br>
<br>
In other cases, permission to use a particular library in 
non-free <br>
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large 
body of free <br>
software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library 
in non-free <br>
programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU 
operating system, <br>
as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system. <br>
<br>
Although the Lesser General Public License is Less 
protective of the <br>
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program 
that is linked <br>
with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run 
that program <br>
using a modified version of the Library. <br>
<br>
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution 
and <br>
modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference 
between a <br>
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the 
library". The <br>
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the 
latter must <br>
be combined with the library in order to run. TERMS AND 
CONDITIONS FOR <br>
COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION <br>
<br>
0. This License Agreement applies to any software library 
or other <br>
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright 
holder or other <br>
authorized party saying it may be distributed under the 
terms of this <br>
Lesser General Public License (also called "this License"). 
Each <br>
licensee is addressed as "you". <br>
<br>
A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or 
data <br>
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application 
programs <br>
(which use some of those functions and data) to form 
executables. <br>
<br>
The "Library", below, refers to any such software library 
or work which <br>
has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on 
the Library" <br>
means either the Library or any derivative work under 
copyright law: <br>
that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion 
of it, either <br>
verbatim or with modifications and/or translated 
straightforwardly into <br>
another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included 
without <br>
limitation in the term "modification".) <br>
<br>
"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the 
work for making <br>
modifications to it. For a library, complete source code 
means all the <br>
source code for all modules it contains, plus any 
associated interface <br>
definition files, plus the scripts used to control 
compilation and <br>
installation of the library. <br>
<br>
Activities other than copying, distribution and 
modification are not <br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The 
act of running <br>
a program using the Library is not restricted, and output 
from such a <br>
program is covered only if its contents constitute a work 
based on the <br>
Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool 
for writing <br>
it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does 
and what the <br>
program that uses the Library does. <br>
<br>
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the 
Library's complete <br>
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that 
you <br>
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an 
appropriate <br>
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact 
all the notices <br>
that refer to this License and to the absence of any 
warranty; and <br>
distribute a copy of this License along with the Library. <br>
<br>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a 
copy, and <br>
you may at your option offer warranty protection in 
exchange for a fee. <br>
<br>
<br>
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any 
portion of <br>
it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and 
distribute <br>
such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 
above, provided <br>
that you also meet all of these conditions: <br>
<br>
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent 
notices <br>
       stating that you changed the files and the date of 
any change.<br>
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed 
at no charge <br>
       to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a 
function or a <br>
       table of data to be supplied by an application 
program that uses <br>
       the facility, other than as an argument passed when 
the facility <br>
       is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort 
to ensure <br>
       that, in the event an application does not supply 
such function <br>
       or table, the facility still operates, and performs 
whatever part <br>
       of its purpose remains meaningful.<br>
<br>
      (For example, a function in a library to compute 
square roots has <br>
      a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent 
of the <br>
      application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that 
any <br>
      application-supplied function or table used by this 
function must <br>
      be optional: if the application does not supply it, 
the square <br>
      root function must still compute square roots.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. 
If <br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the 
Library, and <br>
can be reasonably considered independent and separate works 
in <br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply 
to those <br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But 
when you <br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a 
work based on <br>
the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the 
terms of this <br>
License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to 
the entire <br>
whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who 
wrote it. <br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights 
or contest <br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the 
intent is to <br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of 
derivative or <br>
collective works based on the Library. <br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on 
the Library <br>
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a 
volume of a <br>
storage or distribution medium does not bring the other 
work under the <br>
scope of this License. <br>
<br>
3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU 
General Public <br>
License instead of this License to a given copy of the 
Library. To do <br>
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this 
License, so that <br>
they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, 
version 2, <br>
instead of to this License. (If a newer version than 
version 2 of the <br>
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you 
can specify <br>
that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other 
change in these <br>
notices. <br>
<br>
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is 
irreversible for that <br>
copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to 
all <br>
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy. <br>
<br>
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the 
code of the <br>
Library into a program that is not a library. <br>
<br>
4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or 
derivative <br>
of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form 
under the <br>
terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany 
it with the <br>
complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which 
must be <br>
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a 
medium <br>
customarily used for software interchange. <br>
<br>
If distribution of object code is made by offering access 
to copy from a <br>
designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy 
the source <br>
code from the same place satisfies the requirement to 
distribute the <br>
source code, even though third parties are not compelled to 
copy the <br>
source along with the object code. <br>
<br>
5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of 
the Library, <br>
but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled 
or linked <br>
with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a 
work, in <br>
isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and 
therefore falls <br>
outside the scope of this License. <br>
<br>
However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the 
Library creates <br>
an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because 
it contains <br>
portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the 
library". <br>
The executable is therefore covered by this License. 
Section 6 states <br>
terms for distribution of such executables. <br>
<br>
When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a 
header file <br>
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work 
may be a <br>
derivative work of the Library even though the source code 
is not. <br>
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work 
can be linked <br>
without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. 
The threshold <br>
for this to be true is not precisely defined by law. <br>
<br>
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data 
structure <br>
layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline 
functions (ten <br>
lines or less in length), then the use of the object file 
is <br>
unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a 
derivative work. <br>
(Executables containing this object code plus portions of 
the Library <br>
will still fall under Section 6.) <br>
<br>
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you 
may <br>
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of 
Section 6. <br>
Any executables containing that work also fall under 
Section 6, whether <br>
or not they are linked directly with the Library itself. <br>
<br>
6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also 
combine or link a <br>
"work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a 
work <br>
containing portions of the Library, and distribute that 
work under terms <br>
of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification 
of the work <br>
for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for 
debugging such <br>
modifications. <br>
<br>
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work 
that the <br>
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are 
covered by <br>
this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If 
the work during <br>
execution displays copyright notices, you must include the 
copyright <br>
notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference 
directing the <br>
user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of 
these things: <br>
<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding <br>
       machine-readable source code for the Library 
including whatever <br>
       changes were used in the work (which must be 
distributed under <br>
       Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an 
executable linked <br>
       with the Library, with the complete machine-readable 
"work that <br>
       uses the Library", as object code and/or source 
code, so that the <br>
       user can modify the Library and then relink to 
produce a modified <br>
       executable containing the modified Library. (It is 
understood <br>
       that the user who changes the contents of 
definitions files in <br>
       the Library will not necessarily be able to 
recompile the <br>
       application to use the modified definitions.)<br>
    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking 
with the <br>
       Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses 
at run time a <br>
       copy of the library already present on the user's 
computer <br>
       system, rather than copying library functions into 
the <br>
       executable, and (2) will operate properly with a 
modified version <br>
       of the library, if the user installs one, as long as 
the modified <br>
       version is interface-compatible with the version 
that the work <br>
       was made with.<br>
    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for 
at least three <br>
       years, to give the same user the materials specified 
in <br>
       Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the 
cost of <br>
       performing this distribution.<br>
    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering 
access to copy <br>
       from a designated place, offer equivalent access to 
copy the <br>
       above specified materials from the same place.<br>
    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of 
these <br>
       materials or that you have already sent this user a 
copy.<br>
<br>
For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses 
the Library" <br>
must include any data and utility programs needed for 
reproducing the <br>
executable from it. However, as a special exception, the 
materials to be <br>
distributed need not include anything that is normally 
distributed (in <br>
either source or binary form) with the major components 
(compiler, <br>
kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the 
executable runs, <br>
unless that component itself accompanies the executable. <br>
<br>
It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license 
restrictions <br>
of other proprietary libraries that do not normally 
accompany the <br>
operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use 
both them <br>
and the Library together in an executable that you 
distribute. <br>
<br>
7. You may place library facilities that are a work based 
on the Library <br>
side-by-side in a single library together with other 
library facilities <br>
not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined 
library, <br>
provided that the separate distribution of the work based 
on the Library <br>
and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, 
and provided <br>
that you do these two things: <br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the 
same work based <br>
       on the Library, uncombined with any other library 
facilities. <br>
       This must be distributed under the terms of the 
Sections above.<br>
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of 
the fact that <br>
       part of it is a work based on the Library, and 
explaining where <br>
       to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same 
work.<br>
<br>
8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or 
distribute the <br>
Library except as expressly provided under this License. 
Any attempt <br>
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or 
distribute the <br>
Library is void, and will automatically terminate your 
rights under this <br>
License. However, parties who have received copies, or 
rights, from you <br>
under this License will not have their licenses terminated 
so long as <br>
such parties remain in full compliance. <br>
<br>
9. You are not required to accept this License, since you 
have not <br>
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to 
modify or <br>
distribute the Library or its derivative works. These 
actions are <br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. 
Therefore, by <br>
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on 
the <br>
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to 
do so, and all <br>
its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or 
modifying the <br>
Library or works based on it. <br>
<br>
10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work 
based on the <br>
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license 
from the <br>
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify 
the Library <br>
subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose 
any further <br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights 
granted herein. <br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third 
parties with <br>
this License. <br>
<br>
11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation 
of patent <br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent 
issues), <br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, 
agreement or <br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, 
they do not <br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you 
cannot distribute <br>
so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this 
License and <br>
any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you 
may not <br>
distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent 
license would <br>
not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by 
all those who <br>
receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the 
only way you <br>
could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain 
entirely from <br>
distribution of the Library. <br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or 
unenforceable under <br>
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is 
intended to <br>
apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in 
other <br>
circumstances. <br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to 
infringe any <br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest 
validity of any <br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of 
protecting the <br>
integrity of the free software distribution system which is 
implemented <br>
by public license practices. Many people have made generous <br>
contributions to the wide range of software distributed 
through that <br>
system in reliance on consistent application of that 
system; it is up to <br>
the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to 
distribute <br>
software through any other system and a licensee cannot 
impose that <br>
choice. <br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is 
believed to be <br>
a consequence of the rest of this License. <br>
<br>
12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is 
restricted in <br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted 
interfaces, the <br>
original copyright holder who places the Library under this 
License may <br>
add an explicit geographical distribution limitation 
excluding those <br>
countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or 
among countries <br>
not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates 
the <br>
limitation as if written in the body of this License. <br>
<br>
13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or 
new versions <br>
of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. 
Such new <br>
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, 
but may <br>
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. <br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If 
the Library <br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to 
it and "any <br>
later version", you have the option of following the terms 
and <br>
conditions either of that version or of any later version 
published by <br>
the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not 
specify a license <br>
version number, you may choose any version ever published 
by the Free <br>
Software Foundation. <br>
<br>
14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into 
other free <br>
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible 
with these, <br>
write to the author to ask for permission. For software 
which is <br>
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the 
Free Software <br>
Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our 
decision will be <br>
guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of 
all derivatives <br>
of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse 
of software <br>
generally. <br>
<br>
NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE 
IS NO <br>
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY 
APPLICABLE LAW. <br>
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT 
HOLDERS AND/OR <br>
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY 
OF ANY KIND, <br>
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, 
THE IMPLIED <br>
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR 
PURPOSE. THE <br>
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE 
LIBRARY IS WITH <br>
YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE 
COST OF ALL <br>
NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. <br>
<br>
16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED 
TO IN <br>
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO 
MAY MODIFY <br>
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE 
LIABLE TO YOU FOR <br>
DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR 
CONSEQUENTIAL <br>
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE 
LIBRARY <br>
(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING 
RENDERED <br>
INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A 
FAILURE OF <br>
THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF 
SUCH HOLDER OR <br>
OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH 
DAMAGES. <br>

                       Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
<br>
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http:
//fsf.org/><br>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim 
copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
<br>
  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License 
incorporates<br>
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General 
Public<br>
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed 
below.<br>
<br>
  0. Additional Definitions.<br>
<br>
  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the 
GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 
3 of the GNU<br>
General Public License.<br>
<br>
  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this 
License,<br>
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined 
below.<br>
<br>
  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an 
interface provided<br>
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the 
Library.<br>
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is 
deemed a mode<br>
of using an interface provided by the Library.<br>
<br>
  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or 
linking an<br>
Application with the Library.  The particular version of 
the Library<br>
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the 
"Linked<br>
Version".<br>
<br>
  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work 
means the<br>
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any 
source code<br>
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in 
isolation, are<br>
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.<br>
<br>
  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work 
means the<br>
object code and/or source code for the Application, 
including any data<br>
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined 
Work from the<br>
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the 
Combined Work.<br>
<br>
  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br>
<br>
  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of 
this License<br>
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br>
<br>
  2. Conveying Modified Versions.<br>
<br>
  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your 
modifications, a<br>
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an 
Application<br>
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed 
when the<br>
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the 
modified<br>
version:<br>
<br>
   a) under this License, provided that you make a good 
faith effort to<br>
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply 
the<br>
   function or data, the facility still operates, and 
performs<br>
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or<br>
<br>
   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional 
permissions of<br>
   this License applicable to that copy.<br>
<br>
  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header 
Files.<br>
<br>
  The object code form of an Application may incorporate 
material from<br>
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey 
such object<br>
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the 
incorporated<br>
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data 
structure<br>
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions 
and templates<br>
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the 
following:<br>
<br>
   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object 
code that the<br>
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use 
are<br>
   covered by this License.<br>
<br>
   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL 
and this license<br>
   document.<br>
<br>
  4. Combined Works.<br>
<br>
  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice 
that,<br>
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of 
the<br>
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and 
reverse<br>
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also 
do each of<br>
the following:<br>
<br>
   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined 
Work that<br>
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its 
use are<br>
   covered by this License.<br>
<br>
   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU 
GPL and this license<br>
   document.<br>
<br>
   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices 
during<br>
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library 
among<br>
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user 
to the<br>
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.<br>
<br>
   d) Do one of the following:<br>
<br>
       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the 
terms of this<br>
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a 
form<br>
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user 
to<br>
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified 
version of<br>
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined 
Work, in the<br>
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for 
conveying<br>
       Corresponding Source.<br>
<br>
       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for 
linking with the<br>
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses 
at run time<br>
       a copy of the Library already present on the user's 
computer<br>
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a 
modified version<br>
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the 
Linked<br>
       Version.<br>
<br>
   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you 
would otherwise<br>
   be required to provide such information under section 6 
of the<br>
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is<br>
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of 
the<br>
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the<br>
   Application with a modified version of the Linked 
Version. (If<br>
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must 
accompany<br>
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding 
Application<br>
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the 
Installation<br>
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the 
GNU GPL<br>
   for conveying Corresponding Source.)<br>
<br>
  5. Combined Libraries.<br>
<br>
  You may place library facilities that are a work based on 
the<br>
Library side by side in a single library together with 
other library<br>
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by 
this<br>
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of 
your<br>
choice, if you do both of the following:<br>
<br>
   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the 
same work based<br>
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library 
facilities,<br>
   conveyed under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that 
part of it<br>
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to 
find the<br>
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<br>
  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public 
License.<br>
<br>
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or 
new versions<br>
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. 
Such new<br>
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, 
but may<br>
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If 
the<br>
Library as you received it specifies that a certain 
numbered version<br>
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later 
version"<br>
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms 
and<br>
conditions either of that published version or of any later 
version<br>
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library 
as you<br>
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU 
Lesser<br>
General Public License, you may choose any version of the 
GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License ever published by the Free Software 
Foundation.<br>
<br>
  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy 
can decide<br>
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public 
License shall<br>
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any 
version is<br>
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for 
the<br>
Library.<br>
<br>
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
<br>
Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http:
//fsf.org/> <br>
<br>
<br>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim 
copies of this <br>
license document, but changing it is not allowed. <br>
<br>
Preamble<br>
<br>
The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license 
for software <br>
and other kinds of works. <br>
<br>
The licenses for most software and other practical works 
are designed to <br>
take away your freedom to share and change the works. By 
contrast, the <br>
GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your 
freedom to <br>
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it 
remains free <br>
software for all its users. We, the Free Software 
Foundation, use the <br>
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it 
applies also to <br>
any other work released this way by its authors. You can 
apply it to <br>
your programs, too. <br>
<br>
When we speak of free software, we are referring to 
freedom, not price. <br>
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that 
you have the <br>
freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge 
for them if <br>
you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if 
you want it, <br>
that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new 
free <br>
programs, and that you know you can do these things. <br>
<br>
To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from 
denying you these <br>
rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, 
you have <br>
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the 
software, or if <br>
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of 
others. <br>
<br>
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, 
whether gratis <br>
or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same 
freedoms that <br>
you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or 
can get the <br>
source code. And you must show them these terms so they 
know their <br>
rights. <br>
<br>
Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with 
two steps: (1) <br>
assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this 
License giving <br>
you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it. <br>
<br>
For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL 
clearly explains <br>
that there is no warranty for this free software. For both 
users' and <br>
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be 
marked as <br>
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed 
erroneously to <br>
authors of previous versions. <br>
<br>
Some devices are designed to deny users access to install 
or run <br>
modified versions of the software inside them, although the 
manufacturer <br>
can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim 
of protecting <br>
users' freedom to change the software. The systematic 
pattern of such <br>
abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to 
use, which is <br>
precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have 
designed <br>
this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those 
products. If <br>
such problems arise substantially in other domains, we 
stand ready to <br>
extend this provision to those domains in future versions 
of the GPL, as <br>
needed to protect the freedom of users. <br>
<br>
Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software 
patents. <br>
States should not allow patents to restrict development and 
use of <br>
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that 
do, we wish to <br>
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free 
program could <br>
make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL 
assures that <br>
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free. <br>
<br>
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution 
and <br>
modification follow. <br>
<br>
<br>
TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
0. Definitions.<br>
<br>
"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General 
Public License. <br>
<br>
"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to 
other kinds <br>
of works, such as semiconductor masks. <br>
<br>
"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed 
under this <br>
License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" 
and <br>
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations. <br>
<br>
To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part 
of the <br>
work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other 
than the making <br>
of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified 
version" <br>
of the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work. <br>
<br>
A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a 
work based <br>
on the Program. <br>
<br>
To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, 
without <br>
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable 
for <br>
infringement under applicable copyright law, except 
executing it on a <br>
computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes 
copying, <br>
distribution (with or without modification), making 
available to the <br>
public, and in some countries other activities as well. <br>
<br>
To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that 
enables other <br>
parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a 
user through <br>
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not 
conveying. <br>
<br>
An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal 
Notices" <br>
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently 
visible <br>
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, 
and (2) tells <br>
the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to 
the extent <br>
that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey 
the work under <br>
this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If 
the interface <br>
presents a list of user commands or options, such as a 
menu, a prominent <br>
item in the list meets this criterion. <br>
<br>
1. Source Code.<br>
<br>
The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of 
the work <br>
for making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-
source <br>
form of a work. <br>
<br>
A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an 
official <br>
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the 
case of <br>
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, 
one that is <br>
widely used among developers working in that language. <br>
<br>
The "System Libraries" of an executable work include 
anything, other <br>
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the 
normal form of <br>
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that 
Major <br>
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work 
with that Major <br>
Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which 
an <br>
implementation is available to the public in source code 
form. A <br>
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential <br>
component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the 
specific operating <br>
system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a 
compiler used to <br>
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run 
it. <br>
<br>
The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form 
means all <br>
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an 
executable <br>
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including 
scripts to <br>
control those activities. However, it does not include the 
work's System <br>
Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available 
free programs <br>
which are used unmodified in performing those activities 
but which are <br>
not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source 
includes <br>
interface definition files associated with source files for 
the work, <br>
and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically 
linked <br>
subprograms that the work is specifically designed to 
require, such as <br>
by intimate data communication or control flow between 
those subprograms <br>
and other parts of the work. <br>
<br>
The Corresponding Source need not include anything that 
users can <br>
regenerate automatically from other parts of the 
Corresponding Source. <br>
<br>
The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is 
that same <br>
work. <br>
<br>
<br>
2. Basic Permissions.<br>
<br>
All rights granted under this License are granted for the 
term of <br>
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the 
stated <br>
conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your 
unlimited <br>
permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from 
running a <br>
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, 
given its <br>
content, constitutes a covered work. This License 
acknowledges your <br>
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by 
copyright law. <br>
<br>
You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do 
not convey, <br>
without conditions so long as your license otherwise 
remains in force. <br>
You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose 
of having <br>
them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you 
with <br>
facilities for running those works, provided that you 
comply with the <br>
terms of this License in conveying all material for which 
you do not <br>
control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered 
works for <br>
you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your 
direction and <br>
control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies 
of your <br>
copyrighted material outside their relationship with you. <br>
<br>
Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely 
under the <br>
conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; 
section 10 makes <br>
it unnecessary. <br>
<br>
3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention 
Law.<br>
<br>
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective 
technological <br>
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations 
under article 11 <br>
of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, 
or similar <br>
laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such 
measures. <br>
<br>
When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power 
to forbid <br>
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such 
circumvention <br>
is effected by exercising rights under this License with 
respect to the <br>
covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit 
operation or <br>
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against 
the work's <br>
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid 
circumvention of <br>
technological measures. <br>
<br>
4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br>
<br>
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code 
as you <br>
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously 
and <br>
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright 
notice; keep <br>
intact all notices stating that this License and any non-
permissive <br>
terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; 
keep intact all <br>
notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all 
recipients a copy <br>
of this License along with the Program. <br>
<br>
You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you 
convey, and <br>
you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee. <br>
<br>
5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br>
<br>
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the 
modifications to <br>
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code 
under the terms <br>
of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these 
conditions: <br>
<br>
<br>
 a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you 
modified it, <br>
    and giving a relevant date. <br>
 b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it 
is released <br>
    under this License and any conditions added under 
section 7. This <br>
    requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to 
"keep intact<br>
    all notices". <br>
<br>
 c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under 
this License to <br>
    anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This 
License will<br>
    therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 
additional<br>
    terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, 
regardless of<br>
    how they are packaged. This License gives no permission 
to license<br>
    the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate 
such <br>
    permission if you have separately received it. <br>
<br>
 d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must 
display <br>
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has 
interactive <br>
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal 
Notices, your<br>
    work need not make them do so. <br>
<br>
A compilation of a covered work with other separate and 
independent <br>
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the 
covered work, and <br>
which are not combined with it such as to form a larger 
program, in or <br>
on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called 
an <br>
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright 
are not <br>
used to limit the access or legal rights of the 
compilation's users <br>
beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a 
covered work in <br>
an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the 
other parts of <br>
the aggregate. <br>
<br>
6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br>
<br>
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the 
terms of <br>
sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-
readable <br>
Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in 
one of these <br>
ways: <br>
<br>
 a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical 
product <br>
    including a physical distribution medium), accompanied 
by the <br>
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<br>
    customarily used for software interchange. <br>
<br>
 b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical 
product <br>
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied 
by a<br>
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid 
for <br>
    as long as you offer spare parts or customer support 
for that<br>
    product model, to give anyone who possesses the object 
code <br>
    either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all 
the <br>
    software in the product that is covered by this 
License, on a <br>
    durable physical medium customarily used for software <br>
    interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable 
cost of<br>
    physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) 
access<br>
    to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server 
at no charge. <br>
<br>
 c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy 
of the <br>
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This 
alternative<br>
    is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and 
only if you<br>
    received the object code with such an offer, in accord 
with <br>
    subsection 6b. <br>
<br>
 d) Convey the object code by offering access from a 
designated place <br>
    (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access 
to the <br>
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same 
place at no <br>
    further charge. You need not require recipients to copy 
the <br>
    Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the 
place to<br>
    copy the object code is a network server, the 
Corresponding Source<br>
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a 
third party) <br>
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided 
you maintain<br>
    clear directions next to the object code saying where 
to find the<br>
    Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts 
the <br>
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure 
that it is <br>
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these 
requirements. <br>
<br>
 e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, 
provided you <br>
    inform other peers where the object code and 
Corresponding Source of<br>
    the work are being offered to the general public at no 
charge under <br>
    subsection 6d. <br>
<br>
A separable portion of the object code, whose source code 
is excluded <br>
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not 
be included <br>
in conveying the object code work. <br>
<br>
A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which 
means<br>
any tangible personal property which is normally used for 
personal, <br>
family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or 
sold for <br>
incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a 
product is a <br>
consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor 
of coverage. <br>
For a particular product received by a particular user, 
"normally <br>
used" refers to a typical or common use of that class of 
product, <br>
regardless of the status of the particular user or of the 
way in which <br>
the particular user actually uses, or expects or is 
expected to use, the <br>
product. A product is a consumer product regardless of 
whether the <br>
product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-
consumer uses, <br>
unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use 
of the <br>
product. <br>
<br>
"Installation Information" for a User Product means any 
methods, <br>
procedures, authorization keys, or other information 
required to install <br>
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that 
User Product <br>
from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The 
information <br>
must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of 
the modified <br>
object code is in no case prevented or interfered with 
solely because <br>
modification has been made. <br>
<br>
If you convey an object code work under this section in, or 
with, or <br>
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying 
occurs as <br>
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and 
use of the <br>
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity 
or for a <br>
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is 
characterized), the <br>
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be 
accompanied by <br>
the Installation Information. But this requirement does not 
apply if <br>
neither you nor any third party retains the ability to 
install modified <br>
object code on the User Product (for example, the work has 
been <br>
installed in ROM). <br>
<br>
The requirement to provide Installation Information does 
not include a <br>
requirement to continue to provide support service, 
warranty, or updates <br>
for a work that has been modified or installed by the 
recipient, or for <br>
the User Product in which it has been modified or 
installed. Access to a <br>
network may be denied when the modification itself 
materially and <br>
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates 
the rules and <br>
protocols for communication across the network. <br>
<br>
Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information 
provided, in <br>
accord with this section must be in a format that is 
publicly documented <br>
(and with an implementation available to the public in 
source code <br>
form), and must require no special password or key for 
unpacking, <br>
reading or copying. <br>
<br>
7. Additional Terms.<br>
<br>
"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the 
terms of this <br>
License by making exceptions from one or more of its 
conditions. <br>
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire 
Program shall <br>
be treated as though they were included in this License, to 
the extent <br>
that they are valid under applicable law. If additional 
permissions <br>
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used 
separately <br>
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains 
governed by this <br>
License without regard to the additional permissions. <br>
<br>
When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your 
option remove <br>
any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part 
of it. <br>
(Additional permissions may be written to require their own 
removal in <br>
certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place 
additional <br>
permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, 
for which you <br>
have or can give appropriate copyright permission. <br>
<br>
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for 
material you <br>
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the 
copyright holders <br>
of that material) supplement the terms of this License with 
terms: <br>
<br>
 a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently 
from the <br>
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or <br>
<br>
 b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal 
notices or <br>
    author attributions in that material or in the 
Appropriate Legal<br>
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or <br>
<br>
 c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that 
material, or <br>
    requiring that modified versions of such material be 
marked in <br>
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; 
or <br>
<br>
 d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of 
licensors or <br>
    authors of the material; or e) Declining to grant 
rights under<br>
    trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, 
or service<br>
    marks; or <br>
<br>
 f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of 
that material <br>
    by anyone who conveys the material (or modified 
versions of it)<br>
    with contractual assumptions of liability to the 
recipient, for any<br>
    liability that these contractual assumptions directly 
impose on<br>
    those licensors and authors. <br>
<br>
All other non-permissive additional terms are considered 
"further <br>
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10. If the 
Program as you <br>
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating 
that it is <br>
governed by this License along with a term that is a 
further <br>
restriction, you may remove that term. If a license 
document contains a <br>
further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying 
under this <br>
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by 
the terms of <br>
that license document, provided that the further 
restriction does not <br>
survive such relicensing or conveying. <br>
<br>
If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this 
section, you must <br>
place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the 
additional terms <br>
that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to 
find the <br>
applicable terms. <br>
<br>
Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be 
stated in the <br>
form of a separately written license, or stated as 
exceptions; the above <br>
requirements apply either way. <br>
<br>
8. Termination.<br>
<br>
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as 
expressly <br>
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to 
propagate or <br>
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your 
rights under <br>
this License (including any patent licenses granted under 
the third <br>
paragraph of section 11). <br>
<br>
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then 
your license <br>
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) 
provisionally, <br>
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and 
finally terminates <br>
your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder 
fails to <br>
notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior 
to 60 days <br>
after the cessation. <br>
<br>
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder 
is reinstated <br>
permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the 
violation by <br>
some reasonable means, this is the first time you have 
received notice <br>
of violation of this License (for any work) from that 
copyright holder, <br>
and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your 
receipt of the <br>
notice. <br>
<br>
Termination of your rights under this section does not 
terminate the <br>
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from 
you under <br>
this License. If your rights have been terminated and not 
permanently <br>
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for 
the same <br>
material under section 10. <br>
<br>
9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br>
<br>
You are not required to accept this License in order to 
receive or run a <br>
copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered 
work occurring <br>
solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission 
to receive a <br>
copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing 
other than <br>
this License grants you permission to propagate or modify 
any covered <br>
work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept 
this <br>
License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered 
work, you <br>
indicate your acceptance of this License to do so. <br>
<br>
10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br>
<br>
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient 
automatically <br>
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, 
modify and <br>
propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not 
responsible <br>
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this 
License. <br>
<br>
An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring 
control of an <br>
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or 
subdividing an <br>
organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a 
covered work <br>
results from an entity transaction, each party to that 
transaction who <br>
receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses 
to the work <br>
the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under 
the previous <br>
paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding 
Source of the <br>
work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor 
has it or can <br>
get it with reasonable efforts. <br>
<br>
You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise 
of the <br>
rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, 
you may not <br>
impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise 
of rights <br>
granted under this License, and you may not initiate 
litigation <br>
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) 
alleging that any <br>
patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, 
offering for sale, <br>
or importing the Program or any portion of it. <br>
<br>
11. Patents.<br>
<br>
A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use 
under this <br>
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is 
based. The work <br>
thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor 
version". <br>
<br>
A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent 
claims <br>
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already 
acquired or <br>
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, 
permitted by <br>
this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor 
version, but <br>
do not include claims that would be infringed only as a 
consequence of <br>
further modification of the contributor version. For 
purposes of this <br>
definition, "control" includes the right to grant patent 
sublicenses <br>
in a manner consistent with the requirements of this 
License. <br>
<br>
Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, 
royalty-free <br>
patent license under the contributor's essential patent 
claims, to make, <br>
use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify 
and <br>
propagate the contents of its contributor version. <br>
<br>
In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is 
any express <br>
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to 
enforce a patent <br>
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or 
covenant not to <br>
sue for patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent 
license to a <br>
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to 
enforce a <br>
patent against the party. <br>
<br>
If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent 
license, and <br>
the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for 
anyone to <br>
copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, 
through a <br>
publicly available network server or other readily 
accessible means, <br>
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to 
be so <br>
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the 
benefit of the <br>
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in 
a manner <br>
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend 
the patent <br>
license to downstream recipients. "Knowingly relying" means 
you have <br>
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your 
conveying the <br>
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the 
covered work <br>
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable 
patents in that <br>
country that you have reason to believe are valid. <br>
<br>
If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction 
or <br>
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring 
conveyance of, a <br>
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the 
parties <br>
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, 
propagate, modify or <br>
convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent 
license you <br>
grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the 
covered work <br>
and works based on it. <br>
<br>
A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include 
within <br>
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is 
conditioned <br>
on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are 
specifically <br>
granted under this License. You may not convey a covered 
work if you are <br>
a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the 
business of <br>
distributing software, under which you make payment to the 
third party <br>
based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, 
and under <br>
which the third party grants, to any of the parties who 
would receive <br>
the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license 
(a) in <br>
connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you 
(or copies <br>
made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in 
connection with <br>
specific products or compilations that contain the covered 
work, unless <br>
you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license 
was granted, <br>
prior to 28 March 2007. <br>
<br>
Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or 
limiting any <br>
implied license or other defenses to infringement that may 
otherwise be <br>
available to you under applicable patent law. <br>
<br>
12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.<br>
<br>
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, 
agreement or <br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, 
they do not <br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you 
cannot convey a <br>
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your 
obligations under this <br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a 
consequence you <br>
may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to 
terms that <br>
obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying 
from those to <br>
whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy 
both those <br>
terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from 
conveying the <br>
Program. <br>
<br>
13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<br>
<br>
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you 
have permission <br>
to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed 
under version 3 <br>
of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single 
combined work, <br>
and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License 
will <br>
continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, 
but the special <br>
requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, 
section 13, <br>
concerning interaction through a network will apply to the 
combination <br>
as such. <br>
<br>
14. Revised Versions of this License.<br>
<br>
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new 
versions of <br>
the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new 
versions will <br>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ 
in detail to <br>
address new problems or concerns. <br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If 
the Program <br>
specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU 
General Public <br>
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the 
option of <br>
following the terms and conditions either of that numbered 
version or of <br>
any later version published by the Free Software 
Foundation. If the <br>
Program does not specify a version number of the GNU 
General Public <br>
License, you may choose any version ever published by the 
Free Software <br>
Foundation. <br>
<br>
If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which 
future versions <br>
of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's 
public <br>
statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes 
you to <br>
choose that version for the Program. <br>
<br>
Later license versions may give you additional or different 
permissions. <br>
However, no additional obligations are imposed on any 
author or <br>
copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a 
later version. <br>
<br>
15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br>
<br>
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT 
PERMITTED BY <br>
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE 
COPYRIGHT <br>
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" 
WITHOUT <br>
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, 
INCLUDING, BUT NOT <br>
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND 
FITNESS FOR A <br>
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND 
PERFORMANCE OF <br>
THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE 
DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME <br>
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. <br>
<br>
16. Limitation of Liability.<br>
<br>
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO 
IN WRITING <br>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES 
AND/OR <br>
CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU 
FOR DAMAGES, <br>
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL 
DAMAGES <br>
ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM 
(INCLUDING BUT <br>
NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED 
INACCURATE OR LOSSES <br>
SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE 
PROGRAM TO OPERATE <br>
WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER 
PARTY HAS BEEN <br>
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. <br>
<br>
17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br>
<br>
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability 
provided above <br>
cannot be given local legal effect according to their 
terms, reviewing <br>
courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates 
an absolute <br>
waiver of all civil liability in connection with the 
Program, unless a <br>
warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of 
the Program in <br>
return for a fee. <br>

A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE<br>
==========================<br>
<br>
Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum 
at Stichting<br>
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the 
Netherlands<br>
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains 
Python's<br>
principal author, although it includes many contributions 
from others.<br>
<br>
In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the 
Corporation for<br>
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.
reston.va.us)<br>
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of 
the<br>
software.<br>
<br>
In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team 
moved to<br>
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October 
of the same<br>
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now 
Zope<br>
Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python 
Software<br>
Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was 
formed, a<br>
non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-
related<br>
Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring 
member of<br>
the PSF.<br>
<br>
All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.
opensource.org for<br>
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not 
all, Python<br>
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below 
summarizes<br>
the various releases.<br>

Footnotes:<br>
<br>
(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing 
Python under<br>
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you 
distribute<br>
    a modified version without making your changes open 
source.  The<br>
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine 
Python with<br>
    other software that is released under the GPL; the 
others don't.<br>
<br>
(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-
compatible,<br>
    because its license has a choice of law clause.  
According to<br>
    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer 
that 1.6.1<br>
    is "not incompatible" with the GPL.<br>
<br>
Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under 
Guido's<br>
direction to make these releases possible.<br>

constitute a significant portion of the Technology.<br>
<br>
2.Distribute implementations of the Specification to third 
parties for<br>
their testing and evaluation use, provided that any such<br>
implementation:<br>
<br>
(i) does not modify, subset, superset or otherwise extend 
the Licensor<br>
Name Space, or include any public or protected packages, 
classes, Java<br>
interfaces, fields or methods within the Licensor Name 
Space other than<br>
those required/authorized by the Specification or 
Specifications being<br>
implemented;<br>
<br>

LIMITED LICENSE GRANTS<br>
<br>
1. License for Evaluation Purposes. Specification Lead 
hereby grants<br>
you a fully-paid, non-exclusive, non-transferable, 
worldwide, limited<br>
license (without the right to sublicense), under 
Specification Lead's<br>
applicable intellectual property rights to view, download, 
use and<br>
reproduce the Specification only for the purpose of internal<br>
evaluation. This includes (i) developing applications 
intended to run<br>
on an implementation of the Specification, provided that 
such<br>
applications do not themselves implement any portion(s) of 
the<br>
Specification, and (ii) discussing the Specification with 
any third<br>
party; and (iii) excerpting brief portions of the 
Specification in oral<br>
or written communications which discuss the Specification 
provided that<br>
such excerpts do not in the aggregate constitute a 
significant portion<br>
of the Specification.<br>
<br>
2. License for the Distribution of Compliant 
Implementations.<br>
Specification Lead also grants you a perpetual, non-
exclusive,<br>
non-transferable, worldwide, fully paid-up, royalty free, 
limited<br>
license (without the right to sublicense) under any 
applicable<br>
copyrights or, subject to the provisions of subsection 4 
below, patent<br>
rights it may have covering the Specification to create 
and/or<br>
distribute an Independent Implementation of the 
Specification that: (a)<br>
fully implements the Specification including all its 
required<br>
interfaces and functionality; (b) does not modify, subset, 
superset or<br>
otherwise extend the Licensor Name Space, or include any 
public or<br>
protected packages, classes, Java interfaces, fields or 
methods within<br>
the Licensor Name Space other than those 
required/authorized by the<br>
Specification or Specifications being implemented; and (c) 
passes the<br>
Technology Compatibility Kit (including satisfying the 
requirements of<br>
the applicable TCK Users Guide) for such Specification 
("Compliant<br>
Implementation"). In addition, the foregoing license is 
expressly<br>
conditioned on your not acting outside its scope. No 
license is<br>
granted hereunder for any other purpose (including, for 
example,<br>
modifying the Specification, other than to the extent of 
your fair use<br>
rights, or distributing the Specification to third 
parties). Also, no<br>
right, title, or interest in or to any trademarks, service 
marks, or<br>
trade names of Specification Lead or Specification Lead's 
licensors is<br>
granted hereunder. Java, and Java-related logos, marks and 
names are<br>
trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle America, Inc.

<br>
3. Pass-through Conditions. You need not include 
limitations (a)-(c)<br>
from the previous paragraph or any other particular "pass 
through"<br>
requirements in any license You grant concerning the use of 
your<br>
Independent Implementation or products derived from it. 
However,<br>
except with respect to Independent Implementations (and 
products<br>
derived from them) that satisfy limitations (a)-(c) from 
the previous<br>
paragraph, You may neither: (a) grant or otherwise pass 
through to<br>
your licensees any licenses under Specification Lead's 
applicable<br>
intellectual property rights; nor (b) authorize your 
licensees to make<br>
any claims concerning their implementation's compliance 
with the<br>
Specification in question.<br>
<br>
4. Reciprocity Concerning Patent Licenses.<br>
<br>
a. With respect to any patent claims covered by the license 
granted<br>
under subparagraph 2 above that would be infringed by all 
technically<br>
feasible implementations of the Specification, such license 
is<br>
conditioned upon your offering on fair, reasonable and<br>
non-discriminatory terms, to any party seeking it from You, 
a<br>
perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide 
license under<br>
Your patent rights which are or would be infringed by all 
technically<br>
feasible implementations of the Specification to develop, 
distribute<br>
and use a Compliant Implementation.<br>
<br>
b. With respect to any patent claims owned by Specification 
Lead and<br>
covered by the license granted under subparagraph 2, 
whether or not<br>
their infringement can be avoided in a technically feasible 
manner when<br>
implementing the Specification, such license shall 
terminate with<br>
respect to such claims if You initiate a claim against 
Specification<br>
Lead that it has, in the course of performing its 
responsibilities as<br>
the Specification Lead, induced any other entity to 
infringe Your<br>
patent rights.<br>
<br>
c. Also with respect to any patent claims owned by 
Specification Lead<br>
and covered by the license granted under subparagraph 2 
above, where<br>
the infringement of such claims can be avoided in a 
technically<br>
feasible manner when implementing the Specification such 
license, with<br>
respect to such claims, shall terminate if You initiate a 
claim against<br>
Specification Lead that its making, having made, using, 
offering to<br>
sell, selling or importing a Compliant Implementation 
infringes Your<br>
patent rights.<br>
<br>
5. Definitions. For the purposes of this Agreement: 
"Independent<br>
Implementation" shall mean an implementation of the 
Specification that<br>
neither derives from any of Specification Lead's source 
code or binary<br>
code materials nor, except with an appropriate and separate 
license<br>
from Specification Lead, includes any of Specification 
Lead's source<br>
code or binary code materials; "Licensor Name Space" shall 
mean the<br>
public class or interface declarations whose names begin 
with "java",<br>
"javax", "com.sun" and "com.oracle" or their equivalents in 
any<br>
subsequent naming convention adopted by Oracle America, 
Inc. through<br>
the Java Community Process, or any recognized successors or<br>
replacements thereof; and "Technology Compatibility Kit" or 
"TCK" shall<br>
mean the test suite and accompanying TCK User's Guide 
provided by<br>
